roads","As the human footprint expands worldwide, people and wildlife are coming into greater contact, and areas of human activity may be simultaneously associated with risk and reward for animals. To avoid human threats while exploiting opportunities, animals may adjust their spatiotemporal activity, using areas of anthropogenic disturbance at night when people are less active. We combined four camera trap datasets from Mozambique's Gorongosa National Park to evaluate the effects of roads and settlement on diel activity patterns of elephants (Loxodonta africana). We found high rates of elephant activity along the boundary of the park, where elephants can access cultivated crops, and along roads, which serve as movement corridors. However, elephants restricted their activity to the night and crepuscular periods in these areas of human disturbance, seeking refuge in the interior of the park away from roads and settlements during the day. Our findings suggest that a history of killing and antagonism has instilled a fear of humans in this elephant population, with implications for research, tourism and human-elephant coexistence. Our study highlights the utility of camera traps in monitoring human-wildlife conflict and habituation and demonstrates the value of integrating disparate camera trap datasets for comparative analyses on landscape or even continental scales.","WILEY","DEC",2018,"101111aje12552","[Gaynor, Kaitlyn] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA./[Branco, Paola; Long, Ryan] Univ Idaho, Dept Fish & Wildlife Sci, Moscow, ID 83843 USA./[Goncalves, Dominique] Gorongosa Natl Pk, Dept Sci Serv, Gorongosa, Mozambique./[Goncalves, Dominique] Univ Kent, Durrell Inst Conservat & Ecol, Canterbury, Kent, England./[Granli, Petter; Poole, Joyce] ElephantVoices, Sandefjord, Norway.","Gaynor, KM (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",NA

However, such data have been underutilized in evaluating the impacts of fishing on target and non-target fish stocks or the ramifications of management strategies on fishers. We demonstrate how vessel monitoring system (VMS) data can provide a suite of metrics (such as effort) for improving inputs to stock assessments, dynamic delineation of fishing grounds, and evaluation of regulatory or other (e.g., climatic) impacts on fisher performance. Using > 1 million VMS records from the Gulf of Mexico grouper-tilefish demersal longline fishery, we first develop a generalized additive modeling approach that predicts fishing duration with similar to 85% accuracy. We combine model predictions with logbook data to compare the fishery before and after implementation of a suite of regulatory changes (e.g., a shift to catch share management). We find a large-scale reduction in fleet size, accompanied by reduced fishing effort (duration * number of hooks), shorter trips, lower operational expenses, higher catch rates, and more earnings for those vessels that remained in the fishery. We discuss how the combination of VMS and associated metrics can be expanded for use in management strategy evaluation, parameterizing economic models of fisher behavior, improving fishery-dependent stock assessment indices, and deriving socioeconomic indicators in fisheries worldwide.","ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV","NOV",2018,"101016jfishres201806006","[Watson, Jordan T.] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Auke Bay Labs, 17109 Pt Lena Loop Rd, Juneau, AK 99801 USA./[Watson, Jordan T.; Mueter, Franz J.] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Coll Fisheries & Ocean Sci, 17101 Pt Lena Loop Rd, Juneau, AK 99801 USA./[Haynie, Alan C.] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Resource Ecol & Fisheries Management Div, 7600 Sand Point Way NE,Bldg 4, Seattle, WA 98115 USA./[Sullivan, Patrick J.] Cornell Univ, Dept Nat Resources, 111B Femow Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA./[Perruso, Larry] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Southeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, 75 Virginia Beach Dr, Miami, FL 33149 USA./[O'Farrell, Shay; Sanchirico, James N.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA./[Sanchirico, James N.] Resources Future Inc, Washington, DC 20036 USA.","Watson, JT (reprint author), NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Auke Bay Labs, 17109 Pt Lena Loop Rd, Juneau, AK 99801 USA.",NA

Data was collected from September, 2012 to August, 2013 through continuous focal animal sampling. Types of different food items and its availability in two habitats were mainly responsible for the variations in activity budgets. We found time spent feeding and resting were significantly higher in the urban group whereas, langurs of the rural group spent more time in moving. There were no significant differences in time spent on grooming and other social interactions. Seasonal variations in all major behaviors were significantly affected by groups. Langurs of both groups spent greater time on feeding and resting in the winter than other seasons while moving was at its peak in the summer. Females spent more time in grooming than males while males spent more time in vigilance and interaction than females. The langurs showed a considerable behavioral plasticity in response to variation of habitat and resources, and the knowledge of these differences is important for the conservation and management of this species.","WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH","SEP",2018,"101515mammalia20170074","[Khatun, Mst.

scattering center (ASC); region matching; score fusion","A target recognition method of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images is proposed via matching attributed scattering centers (ASCs) to binary target regions. The ASCs extracted from the test image are predicted as binary regions. In detail, each ASC is first transformed to the image domain based on the ASC model. Afterwards, the resulting image is converted to a binary region segmented by a global threshold. All the predicted binary regions of individual ASCs from the test sample are mapped to the binary target regions of the corresponding templates. Then, the matched regions are evaluated by three scores which are combined as a similarity measure via the score-level fusion. In the classification stage, the target label of the test sample is determined according to the fused similarities. The proposed region matching method avoids the conventional ASC matching problem, which involves the assignment of ASC sets. In addition, the predicted regions are more robust than the point features. The Moving and Stationary Target Acquisition and Recognition (MSTAR) dataset is used for performance evaluation in the experiments. According to the experimental results, the method in this study outperforms some traditional methods reported in the literature under several different operating conditions. Under the standard operating condition (SOC), the proposed method achieves very good performance, with an average recognition rate of 98.34%, which is higher than the traditional methods. Moreover, the robustness of the proposed method is also superior to the traditional methods under different extended operating conditions (EOCs), including configuration variants, large depression angle variation, noise contamination, and partial occlusion.","MDPI","SEP",2018,"103390s18093019","[Tan, Jian; Fan, Xiangtao] Hainan Key Lab Earth Observat, Sanya 572029, Peoples R China./[Tan, Jian; Fan, Xiangtao; Ren, Yingchao] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Remote Sensing & Digital Earth, Key Lab Digital Earth Sci, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China./[Wang, Shenghua] Beijing Informat Sci & Technol Univ, Sch Publ Adm & Mass Media, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China.","Wang, SH (reprint author), Beijing Informat Sci & Technol Univ, Sch Publ Adm & Mass Media, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China.",NA

mustelina; Radio telemetry; Wood thrush","Background: Persistent declines in migratory songbird populations continue to motivate research exploring contributing factors to inform conservation efforts. Nearctic-Neotropical migratory species' population declines have been linked to habitat loss and reductions in habitat quality due to increasing urbanization in areas used throughout the annual cycle. Despite an increase in the number of studies on post-fledging ecology, generally characterized by the period between fledging and dispersal from natal areas or migration, contextual research linking post-fledging survival and habitat use to anthropogenic factors remains limited.
Methods: Here, we examined habitat use of post-fledging habitat-generalist gray catbirds (Dumetella caroliniensis), and habitat-specialist wood thrushes (Hylocichla mustelina), up to 88 days after fledging within an urbanized landscape. These Neotropical migratory species share many life-history traits, exhibit differential degrees of habitat specialization, and co-occur in urbanized landscapes. Starting from daily movement data, we used time-integrated Brownian bridges to generate probability density functions of each species' probability of occurrence, and home range among 16 land cover classes including roads from the US Geological Survey National Land Cover Database for each species.
Results: Habitat use differed between pre-and post-independence periods. After controlling for factors that influence habitat use (i.e., pre- or post-independence period, fate (whether individuals survived or not), and land cover class), we found that wood thrushes occupied home ranges containing six times more forest land cover than catbirds. In contrast, catbirds occupied home ranges containing twice the area of roads compared to wood thrushes. Wood thrushes had greater variance for area used (km(2)) among land cover classes within home ranges compared to catbirds. However, once fledglings achieved independence from parents, wood thrushes had lower variance associated with area used compared to catbirds.
Conclusions: Our findings support predictions that habitat-generalist gray catbirds spend more time in developed areas, less time in forest habitat, and use areas with more roads than the forest-specialist wood thrush. We found strong effects of pre-and post-independence periods on all of the response variables we tested. Species-specific habitat use patterns will likely be affected by projected increases in urbanization over the next several decades leading to further reductions in available forest habitat and increased road density, and will have important implications for the ecology and conservation of these birds.","BMC","AUG 20",2018,"101186s4046201801326","[Ladin, Zachary S.; Bowman, Jacob L.; Buler, Jeffrey J.; Shriver, W.

Non-target species","Diversionary feeding (i.e. supplementary feeding used to mitigate damage to human activities) is a management tool widely employed to avoid human-wildlife conflicts, which could alter the spatial behaviour of target species and can also affect other species present in the area, among other effects. We evaluated the effect of diversionary feeding in the spatial behaviour of the aoudad (Ammotragus lervia), an exotic ungulate associated with crop damage in the area, and we assessed the use of diversionary feeding stations (DFS) by non-target species. Nine aoudads were tracked with GPS/GSM collars. We compared their core home ranges and number of GPS locations in the DFS before and meanwhile food was available on them. Eight DFS were monitored with cameras to identify which species used the feeding sites. The home ranges changed for some individuals, but this variation was not related to supplementary feeding. Just five out of the nine tracked aoudads used DFS, and the number of GPS locations in the DFS by aoudad increased when food was available. DFS were used by fifteen non-target species of birds and mammals, and especially by the wild boar. Aoudads and wild boars segregated temporally but not spatially in their use of the DFS. Our study suggests that diversionary feeding had a limited effect on the spatial behaviour of the aoudad, suggesting that its effectiveness to reduce crop damage may be restricted.","SPRINGER","DEC",2018,"101007s1034401812266","[Pascual-Rico, Roberto; Manuel Perez-Garcia, Juan; Sebastian-Gonzalez, Esther; Botella, Francisco; Gimenez, Andres; Antonio Sanchez-Zapata, Jose] Univ Miguel Hernandez Elche, Dept Appl Biol, Alicante, Spain./[Manuel Perez-Garcia, Juan] Univ Lleida, Dept Anim Prod, Lleida, Spain./[Eguia, Sergio] Mendijob SL, Murcia, Spain.","Pascual-Rico, R (reprint author), Univ Miguel Hernandez Elche, Dept Appl Biol, Alicante, Spain.",NA

However, observation gaps and missing records are unavoidable because the focal individual can move out of sight and recording devices do not always work properly. Using an inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) framework, we have developed a novel gap-filling method to predict the most likely route that an animal would have traveled; within this framework, an algorithm learns a reward function from animal trajectories to find the environmental features preferred by the animal. We applied this approach to GPS trajectories obtained from streaked shearwaters (Calonectris leucomelas) and provide evidence of the advantages of the IRL approach over previously used interpolation methods. These advantages are as follows: (1) No assumptions about the parametric distribution governing movements are needed, (2) no assumptions regarding landscape preferences and restrictions are needed, and (3) large spatiotemporal gaps can be filled. This work demonstrates how IRL can enhance the ability to fill gaps in animal trajectories and construct reward-space maps in heterogeneous environments. The proposed methodology can assist movement research, which seeks to understand phenomena that are ecologically and evolutionarily significant, such as habitat selection and migration.","WILEY","OCT",2018,"101002ecs22447","[Hirakawa, Tsubasa; Yamashita, Takayoshi; Fujiyoshi, Hironobu] Chubu Univ, Dept Comp Sci, 1200 Matsumoto, Kasugai, Aichi 4870027, Japan./[Tamaki, Toru] Hiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Engn, 1-4-1 Kagamiyama, Higashihiroshima, Hiroshima 7398527, Japan./[Umezu, Yuta; Takeuchi, Ichiro] Nagoya Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Showa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4668555, Japan./[Takeuchi, Ichiro] RIKEN Ctr Adv Intelligence Project, Chuo Ku, 1-4-1 Nihonbashi, Tokyo 1030027, Japan./[Takeuchi, Ichiro] Natl Inst Mat Sci, Ctr Mat Res Informat Integrat, 1-2-1 Sengen, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050047, Japan./[Matsumoto, Sakiko; Yoda, Ken] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Chikusa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan.","Hirakawa, T (reprint author), Chubu Univ, Dept Comp Sci, 1200 Matsumoto, Kasugai, Aichi 4870027, Japan.",NA

An accelerometric device (Myotest), a jump mat (Ergojump), an optical device (Optojump), and a smartphone app (MyJump) were simultaneously examined for concurrent validity against gold-standard measures (motion-capture system and a force platform). Twenty-two CMJ-derived variables were collected from 15 healthy male subjects (n = 60 CMJs). Contraction time (CT) and eccentric duration (EccD) measurements obtained from the Myotest were moderately to largely associated with and not different from force platform measurements (r = 0.31 to 0.64, ES = 0.11 to 0.18) and showed moderate test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.92 to 0.97, coefficient of variation (CV) = 3.8 to 8.0%). Flight time (FT) and jump height (JH) from Ergojump, Optojump, and MyJump showed moderate to strong associations with gold-standard measurements (r = 0.57 to 0.98) and good test-retest reliability (ICC = 0.54 to 0.97, CV = 1.8 to 4.2). However, all portable devices underestimated JH (ES = 1.25 to 2.75). Independent of the instrument used, the analyzed CMJ variables showed good capacity to detect changes (standard error of measurement (SEM) < smallest worthwhile change (SWC)), with the exception of rate of force and rate of power development parameters, which showed marginal capacity (SEM > SWC). The Myotest is preferable to measure temporal parameters during ground contact, whereas Ergojump, Optojump, and MyJump devices may be preferable to measure FT and JH, with the Optojump being the most accurate.","MDPI","SEP",2018,"103390sports6030091","[Rago, Vincenzo; Carvalho, Thiago; Fernandes, Tiago; Rebelo, Antonio] Univ Porto, Ctr Res Educ Innovat & Intervent Sports, P-4099002 Porto, Portugal./[Rago, Vincenzo; Brito, Joao; Figueiredo, Pedro] Portuguese Football Federat, Portugal Football Sch, P-1495433 Oeiras, Portugal./[Figueiredo, Pedro] Univ Inst Maia, Res Ctr Sports Sci Hlth Sci & Human Dev, CIDESD, ISMAI, P-4475690 Maia, Portugal./[Fonseca, Pedro] Univ Porto, Porto Biomech Lab, P-4099002 Porto, Portugal.","Rago, V (reprint author), Univ Porto, Ctr Res Educ Innovat & Intervent Sports, P-4099002 Porto, Portugal.; Rago, V (reprint author), Portuguese Football Federat, Portugal Football Sch, P-1495433 Oeiras, Portugal.",NA

Ectosymbionts of amphibious animals face the added challenge of having to survive dramatic environmental changes as their hosts cross ecosystem boundaries. Within freshwaters, crayfish are amongst the most widespread invasive species that readily disperse overland and are host to a wide range of ectosymbionts. Relatively little is known about the transmission of these ectosymbionts, including their ability to survive overland host migration. Here, we assessed terrestrial emigration and both inter- and intra-specific transmissions of Xironogiton victoriensis, a non-native branchiobdellidan (Annelida: Clitellata) recently found on invasive signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) in the UK. These branchiobdellidans tolerated desiccation and did not alter host terrestrial behaviour. Transmission was rapid between natural signal and novel virile (Orconectes cf. virilis) crayfish hosts, with host interactions facilitating transmission. Thus, branchiobdellidans can disperse via amphibious host behaviour and readily infect novel hosts. These traits facilitate symbionts' survival and provide access to additional dispersal pathways that are likely to aid transmission.","SPRINGER","SEP",2018,"101007s1075001836473","[Hunt, Rhiannon; Thomas, John Rhidian; James, Joanna; Cable, Joanne] Cardiff Univ, Sch Biosci, Cardiff CF10 3AX, S Glam, Wales./[James, Joanna] Environm Agcy, Natl Fisheries Serv, Bromholme Lane, Brampton PE28 4NE, England.","Cable, J (reprint author), Cardiff Univ, Sch Biosci, Cardiff CF10 3AX, S Glam, Wales.",NA
