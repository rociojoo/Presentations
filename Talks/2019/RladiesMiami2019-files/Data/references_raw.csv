"savedrecs (30).txt","Plant-pollinator networks have been widely used to understand the ecology of mutualistic interactions between plants and animals. While a number of general patterns have been identified, the mechanisms underlying the structure of plant-pollinator networks are poorly understood. Here we present an agent based model (ABM) that simulates the movement of bees over heterogeneous landscapes and captures pollination events, enabling the influence of landscape pattern on pollination networks to be explored. Using the model, we conducted a series of experiments using virtual landscapes representing a gradient of forest loss and fragmentation. The ABM was able to produce expected trends in network structure, from simulations of interactions between individual plants and pollinators. For example, results indicated an increase in the index of complementary specialization (H-2') and a decline in network connectance with increasing forest cover. Furthermore, network nestedness was not associated with the degree of forest cover, but was positively related to forest patch size, further supporting results obtained in the field. This illustrates the potential value of ABMs for exploring the structure and dynamics of plant-pollinator networks, and for understanding the mechanisms that underlie them. We attribute the results obtained primarily to a shift from specialist to generalist pollinators with increasing forest loss, a trend that has been observed in some field situations.","Newton, Adrian C.

"savedrecs (30).txt","BackgroundSocial insects are among the most serious invasive pests in the world, particularly successful at monopolizing environmental resources to outcompete native species and achieve ecological dominance. The invasive success of some social insects is enhanced by their unicolonial structure, under which the presence of numerous queens and the lack of aggression against non-nestmates allow high worker densities, colony growth, and survival while eliminating intra-specific competition. In this study, we investigated the population genetics, colony structure and levels of aggression in the tawny crazy ant, Nylanderia fulva, which was recently introduced into the United States from South America.ResultsWe found that this species experienced a genetic bottleneck during its invasion lowering its genetic diversity by 60%. Our results show that the introduction of N. fulva is associated with a shift in colony structure. This species exhibits a multicolonial organization in its native range, with colonies clearly separated from one another, whereas it displays a unicolonial system with no clear boundaries among nests in its invasive range. We uncovered an absence of genetic differentiation among populations across the entire invasive range, and a lack of aggressive behaviors towards conspecifics from different nests, even ones separated by several hundreds of kilometers.ConclusionsOverall, these results suggest that across its entire invasive range in the U.S.A., this species forms a single supercolony spreading more than 2000km. In each invasive nest, we found several, up to hundreds, of reproductive queens, each being mated with a single male. The many reproductive queens per nests, together with the free movement of individuals between nests, leads to a relatedness coefficient among nestmate workers close to zero in introduced populations, calling into question the stability of this unicolonial system in which indirect fitness benefits to workers is apparently absent.","Eyer, Pierre-Andre

"savedrecs (30).txt","In movement ecology, the few works that have taken collective behaviour into account are data-driven and rely on simplistic theoretical assumptions, relying in metrics that may or may not be measuring what is intended. In the present paper, we focus on pairwise joint-movement behaviour, where individuals move together during at least a segment of their path. We investigate the adequacy of twelve metrics introduced in previous works for assessing joint movement by analysing their theoretical properties and confronting them with contrasting case scenarios. Two criteria are taken into account for review of those metrics: 1) practical use, and 2) dependence on parameters and underlying assumptions. When analysing the similarities between the metrics as defined, we show how some of them can be expressed using general mathematical forms. In addition, we evaluate the ability of each metric to assess specific aspects of joint-movement behaviour: proximity (closeness in space-time) and coordination (synchrony) in direction and speed. We found that some metrics are better suited to assess proximity and others are more sensitive to coordination. To help readers choose metrics, we elaborate a graphical representation of the metrics in the coordination and proximity space based on our results, and give a few examples of proximity and coordination focus in different movement studies.","Joo, Rocio

"savedrecs (30).txt","BackgroundOur picture of behavioral management of risk by prey remains fragmentary. This partly stems from a lack of studies jointly analyzing different behavioral responses developed by prey, such as habitat use and fine-scale behavior, although they are expected to complement each other. We took advantage of a simple system on the Kerguelen archipelago, made of a prey species, European rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus, a predator, feral cat Felis catus, and a mosaic of closed and open foraging patches, allowing reliable assessment of spatio-temporal change in predation risk. We investigated the way such a change triggered individual prey decisions on where, when and how to perform routine activities.ResultsRabbit presence and behavior were recorded both day and night in patches with similar foraging characteristics, but contrasted in terms of openness. Cats, individually recognizable, were more active at night and in closed patches, in line with their expected higher hunting success in those conditions. Accordingly, rabbits avoided using closed patches at night and increased their vigilance if they did. Both day and night, rabbits increased their use of closed patches as compared to open patches in windy conditions, thereby probably reducing the thermoregulatory costs expected under such harsh environmental conditions.ConclusionsOverall, our data map the landscape of fear in this study system and indicate that prey habitat use and vigilance complement each other. Solely focusing on one or the other tactic may lead to erroneous conclusions regarding the way predation risk triggers prey decisions. Finally, future studies should investigate inter-individual variability in the relative use of these different types of complementary behavioral responses to perceived risk, along with the determinants and outcomes of such tactics.","Blanchard, Pierrick

"savedrecs (30).txt","BackgroundSpace use strategies by foraging animals are often considered to be species-specific. However, similarity between conspecific strategies may also result from similar resource environments. Here, we revisit classic predictions of the relationships between the resource distribution and foragers' space use by tracking free-living foragers of a single species in two contrasting resource landscapes. At two main non-breeding areas along the East-Atlantic flyway (Wadden Sea, The Netherlands and Banc d'Arguin, Mauritania), we mapped prey distributions and derived resource landscapes in terms of the predicted intake rate of red knots (Calidris canutus), migratory molluscivore shorebirds. We tracked the foraging paths of 13 and 38 individual red knots at intervals of 1s over two and five weeks in the Wadden Sea and at Banc d'Arguin, respectively. Mediated by competition for resources, we expected aggregation to be strong and site fidelity weak in an environment with large resource patches. The opposite was expected for small resource patches, but only if local resource abundances were high.ResultsCompared with Banc d'Arguin, resource patches in the Wadden Sea were larger and the maximum local resource abundance was higher. However, because of constraints set by digestive capacity, the average potential intake rates by red knots were similar at the two study sites. Space-use patterns differed as predicted from these differences in resource landscapes. Whereas foraging red knots in the Wadden Sea roamed the mudflats in high aggregation without site fidelity (i.e. grouping nomads), at Banc d'Arguin they showed less aggregation but were strongly site-faithful (i.e. solitary residents).ConclusionThe space use pattern of red knots in the two study areas showed diametrically opposite patterns. These differences could be explained from the distribution of resources in the two areas. Our findings imply that intraspecific similarities in space use patterns represent responses to similar resource environments rather than species-specificity. To predict how environmental change affects space use, we need to understand the degree to which space-use strategies result from developmental plasticity and behavioural flexibility. This requires not only tracking foragers throughout their development, but also tracking their environment in sufficient spatial and temporal detail.","Oudman, Thomas

Most prior research has focused on observer's ability to update perception by executing experimenter-specified exploratory behaviors, however, the question of how observers spontaneously choose how to explore has been overlooked. We asked how effectively adults decide to explore when adapting to changes in their ability to squeeze through doorways. Results revealed that participants made efficient decisions about when to explore by approaching and practicing-they most often explored doorways that were near the limit of their abilities, and participants explored less often as their perceptual calibration improved. However, participants made sub-optimal decisions about how to explore, which resulted in a failure to fully recalibrate.

"savedrecs (30).txt","BackgroundGrazed grassland management regimes can have various effects on soil fauna. For example, effects on earthworms can be negative through compaction induced by grazing animals, or positive mediated by increases in sward productivity and cattle dung pats providing a food source. Knowledge gaps exist in relation to the behaviour of different earthworm species i.e. their movement towards and aggregation under dung pats, the legacy effects of pats and the spatial area of recruitment. The present study addressed these knowledge gaps in field experiments, over 2years, using natural and simulated dung pats on two permanent, intensively grazed pastures in Ireland.ResultsDung pats strongly affected spatial earthworm distribution, with up to four times more earthworms aggregating beneath pats, than in the control locations away from pats. In these earthworm communities comprising 11 species, temporally different aggregation and dispersal patterns were observed, including absence of individual species from control locations, but no clear successional responses. Epigeic species in general, but also certain species of the anecic and endogeic groups were aggregating under dung. Sampling after complete dung pat disappearance (27weeks after application) suggested an absence of a dung pat legacy effect on earthworm communities. Based on species distributions, the maximum size of the recruitment area from which earthworms moved to pats was estimated to be 3.8m(2) per dung pat. Since actual grazing over 6weeks would result in the deposition of about 300 dung pats per ha, it is estimated that a surface area of 1140m(2) or about 11% of the total grazing area can be influenced by dung pats in a given grazing period.ConclusionsThis study showed that the presence of dung pats in pastures creates temporary hot spots in spatial earthworm species distribution, which changes over time. The findings highlight the importance of considering dung pats, temporally and spatially, when sampling earthworms in grazed pastures. Published comparisons of grazed and cut grasslands probably reached incorrect conclusions by ignoring or deliberately avoiding dung pats. Furthermore, the observed intense aggregation of earthworms beneath dung pats suggests that earthworm functions need to be assessed separately at these hot spots.","Bacher, M. G.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Lameness is a key health and welfare issue affecting commercial herds of dairy cattle, with potentially significant economic impacts due to the expense of treatment and lost milk production. Existing lameness detection methods can be time-intensive, and under-detection remains a significant problem leading to delayed or missed treatment. Hence, there is a need for automated monitoring systems that can quickly and accurately detect lameness in individual cows within commercial dairy herds. Recent advances in sensor tracking technology have made it possible to observe the movement, behaviour and space-use of a range of animal species over extended time-scales. However, little is known about how observed movement behaviour and space-use patterns in individual dairy cattle relate to lameness, or to other possible confounding factors such as parity or number of days in milk. In this cross-sectional study, ten lame and ten non-lame barn-housed dairy cows were classified through mobility scoring and subsequently tracked using a wireless local positioning system. Nearly 900,000 spatial locations were recorded in total, allowing a range of movement and spaceuse measures to be determined for each individual cow. Using linear models, we highlight where lameness, parity, and the number of days in milk have a significant effect on the observed space-use patterns. Non-lame cows spent more time, and had higher site fidelity (on a day-to-day basis they were more likely to revisit areas they had visited previously), in the feeding area. Non-lame cows also had a larger full range size within the barn. In contrast, lame cows spent more time, and had a higher site-fidelity, in the cubicle (resting) areas of the barn than non-lame cows. Higher parity cows were found to spend more time in the right-hand-side area of the barn, closer to the passageway to the milking parlour. The number of days in milk was found to positively affect the core range size, but with a negative interaction effect with lameness. Using a simple predictive model, we demonstrate how it is possible to accurately determine the lameness status of all individual cows within the study 16 using only two observed space-use measures, the proportion of time spent in the feeding area and the full range size. Our findings suggest that differences in individual movement and space-use behaviour could be used as indicators of health status for automated monitoring within a Precision Livestock Farming approach, potentially leading to faster diagnosis and treatment, and improved animal welfare for dairy cattle and other managed animal species.","Diosdado, Jorge A.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Temperature is among the most ubiquitous determinants of organism growth, survival, and reproduction. Accurate recordings and predictions of how the temperatures of plants and animals vary in time and space are therefore critical to forecasting the likely impacts of global climate change. Intertidal zones have long served as a model ecosystem for examining the role of environmental stress on patterns of species distributions, and are emerging as models for understanding the ecological impacts of climate change. Intertidal environments are among the most physically demanding habitats on the planet, and excursions in body temperature of ectotherms can exceed 25 degrees C over the course of a few hours. It is now well-known that the body temperatures of intertidal organisms can deviate significantly from the temperature of the surrounding air and substrate due to the influence of solar radiation, and that their size, color, morphology, and material properties markedly influence their temperatures. While many intertidal organisms are slow moving or almost entirely sessile, for others, behavior can play a significant role in driving vulnerability to temperature extremes. We explore datalogging methods used in intertidal zones and discuss the advantages and drawbacks of each. We show how measurements made in situ reveal patterns of thermal stress that otherwise would be undetectable using more remotely-sensed data. Additionally, we explore the idea that the relevant ""grain size"" of the physical environment, and thus the spatial scale that must be measured, is a function of (1) the size of the organism relative to local refugia; (2) an organism's ability to sense and to some degree predict near-term environmental conditions; and (3) an animal's movement speed and directionality toward refugia. Similarly, relevant temporal scales depend on the size, behavior, and physiological response of the organism. While miniaturization of dataloggers has significantly improved, several significant limitations still exist, many of which relate to difficulties in recording behavioral responses to changing environmental conditions. We discuss recent innovations in monitoring and modeling intertidal temperatures, and the important role that they have played in bridging ecological and physiological studies of ongoing impacts of climate change.","Judge, Richard

"savedrecs (30).txt","Understanding multi-agent cooperative behavior is challenging in various scientific and engineering domains. In some cases, such as team sports, many cooperative behaviors can be visually categorized and labeled manually by experts. However, these actions which are manually categorized with the same label based on its function have low spatiotemporal similarity. In other words, it is difficult to find similar and different structures of the motions with the same and different labels, respectively. Here, we propose an automatic recognition system for strategic cooperative plays, which are the minimal, basic, and diverse plays in a ball game. Using player's moving distance, geometric information, and distances among players, the proposed method accurately discriminated not only the cooperative plays in a primary area, i.e., near the ball, but also those distant from a primary area. We also propose a method to classify more detailed types of cooperative plays in various situations. The proposed framework, which sheds light on inconspicuous players to play important roles, could have a potential to detect well-defined and labeled cooperative behaviors.","Hojo, Motokazu

"savedrecs (30).txt","Many animal signals are complex, often combining multimodal components with dynamic motion. To understand the function and evolution of these displays, it is vital to appreciate their spatiotemporal organization. Male broad-tailed hummingbirds (Selasphorus platycercus) perform dramatic U-shaped courtship dives over females, appearing to combine rapid movement and dive-specific mechanical noises with visual signals from their iridescent gorgets. To understand how motion, sound and color interact in these spectacular displays, we obtained video and audio recordings of dives performed by wild hummingbirds. We then applied a multi-angle imaging technique to estimate how a female would perceive the male's iridescent gorget throughout the dive. We show that the key physical, acoustic and visual aspects of the dive are remarkably synchronized-all occurring within 300 milliseconds. Our results highlight the critical importance of accounting for motion and orientation when investigating animal displays: speed and trajectory affect how multisensory signals are produced and perceived.","Hogan, Benedict G.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in badminton commonly occur during single-leg landing after an overhead stroke in the backhand-side court. This study compared differences in trunk acceleration and kinematic variables during single-leg landing in the forehand- and backhand-side courts after an overhead stroke. Eighteen female junior badminton players performed two singles games while wearing a tri-axial accelerometer. The moment that over 4g of resultant acceleration was generated was determined using synchronised video cameras. Trunk lateral inclination and hip abduction angles at the point of landing with over 4g of resultant acceleration were analysed. Mediolateral acceleration in the backhand-side court was greater than that in the opposite-side court (p < 0.001, ES = 0.840). Both trunk lateral angles were larger than those previously reported in injured participants and the hip abduction angle in the backhand-side court was larger than that in the forehand-side court (p < 0.001, ES = 2.357). The lateral and vertical acceleration in the backhand-side court showed moderate-to-strong correlations with the trunk and hip angles. The mediolateral physical demand and high-risk posture in the backhand-side court may be associated with a higher incidence of knee injuries during badminton games.","Sasaki, Shogo

"savedrecs (30).txt","The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of shaft torque (torsional rigidity) on clubhead kinematics and the resulting flight of the ball. Two driver shafts with disparate levels of torque, but otherwise very similar properties, were tested by 40 right-handed golfers representing a range of abilities. Shaft deflection data as well as grip and clubhead kinematics were collected from 14 swings, with each shaft, for each golfer using an optical motion capture system. Ball flight and additional clubhead kinematics were collected using a Doppler radar launch monitor. At impact, the high torque shaft (HT) was associated with increased delivered loft (P = .028) and a more open face (P < .001) relative to the low torque shaft (LT). This resulted in the HT shaft being associated with a ball finishing position that was further right (P = .002). At the individual level, the change in face angle due solely to shaft deformation was significantly higher for the HT shaft for 25/40 participants. Although shaft twist was not directly measured, it was logically deduced using the collected data that these outcomes were the result of the HT being twisted more open relative to the LT shaft at impact.","Mackenzie, Sasho James

"savedrecs (30).txt","Trip purpose inference is critical in transportation demand management (TDM) as well as traffic congestion alleviation. However, destination choice can be affected by a variety of factors, many of which are difficult to determine (e.g. socio-demographics). Besides, the spatio-temporal variation and correlation inherent in travel patterns further intensify the difficulty of understanding destination choice behavior. To this end, this research proposes a Bayesian hierarchical approach for modeling the destination choice behavior through time and space. The proposed method can take into account both the unavailable factors and spatio-temporal correlations by introducing random fields. Moreover, the implementation of the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximations (INLA) combined with the Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE) makes it computationally feasible to model large-scale spatio-temporal correlation structures. The model is further applied to two-week data from more than 8000 taxis in Harbin. The empirical results indicate that the proposed approach is capable to capture spatio-temporal variability in destination distribution, and the inclusion of spatial and temporal random effects is of great help to improve the model performance. The case study also examines how the land-use types influence the destination choice. It is believed that the modeling method and the exploratory spatial-temporal analysis of destination distribution in this study can enriches the methodologies for travel demand modeling as well as decision support for transport policy development.

"savedrecs (30).txt","In simulation studies of crowd behaviors, group behavioral modeling is the core issue of crowd simulation evacuation research. The core issue in group behavioral modeling is how to construct the group. This paper proposes examining the dissimilarities between pedestrians by tracing the trajectories of pedestrians from real videos and constructing groups under real scenes based on the dissimilarities between individuals according to the principle of common fate. The inter-group dissimilarity and intra-group dissimilarity are calculated by pedestrians' trajectories and groups obtained. We present an improved social force model by the social comparison theory and intra-group attraction strategy combined with the data from video. In this paper, the scene information, the locations of the pedestrians, the groups of pedestrians, the intra-group dissimilarity and the inter-group dissimilarity are extracted from the real video. In addition, we considered intra-group attraction and the characteristic of the social comparison theory that lead pedestrians to gather together in emergency. Therefore, the method proposed in this paper has higher authenticity. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we qualitatively and quantitatively designed comparative experiments, respectively. The experimental results show that the method can simulate the group behavior and reproduce the evacuation of people in emergency in real scenes. This model can serve as an important tool to predict evacuation statuses in different population densities and group distributions in emergency. It provides a basis for the establishment of a system to track pedestrians and predict their congestion. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Zhang, Jianxin

Behavioral results were collected through several field experiments aimed at investigating vehicle evacuations, the time required to open vertical evacuation passages, slide and stairs descending with and without counter flows. The results show that the individual movement speed in staircase was lower than the speed in slide, but the average Occupant Flow Rate (OFR) in staircase was higher than the OFR in slide. The probable reasons were discussed and analyzed. Females had worse performance when opening the exit door than males. The upstairs movement of firefighters was observed not negatively affect the evacuation performance of occupants down stairs. The replicated experiments showed that appropriate training or drills can help improve the movement speed of occupants. The results of this study will be essential to evaluate evacuation capacity and occupant behavior on stairs and slides of underwater shield tunnels. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

"savedrecs (30).txt","A novel anomaly detection procedure based on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) mean-reverting stochastic process is presented. The considered anomaly is a vessel that deviates from a planned route, changing its nominal velocity vo. In order to hide this behavior, the vessel switches off its automatic identification system (AIS) device for a time T and then tries to revert to the previous nominal velocity v(0) . The decision that has to be made is declaring that a deviation either happened or not, relying only upon two consecutive AIS contacts. Furthermore, the extension to the scenario in which multiple contacts (e.g., radar) are available during the time period T is also considered. A proper statistical hypothesis testing procedure that builds on the changes in the OU process long-term velocity parameter v o of the vessel is the core of the proposed approach and enables the solution of the anomaly detection problem. Closed analytical forms are provided for the detection and false alarm probabilities of the hypothesis test.","d'Afflisio, Enrica

"savedrecs (30).txt","Background
Primary care practitioners (PCP) play key roles in cervical cancer prevention. Human papillomavirus (HPV) knowledge is an important influence on PCPs' cervical cancer prevention-related behaviours. We investigated HPV knowledge, and associated factors, among general practitioners (GPs) and practice nurses.
Methods
A survey, including factual questions about HPV infection and vaccination, was mailed to GPs and practice nurses in Ireland. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine which PCPs had low knowledge (questions correctly answered: infection <= 5/11; vaccination: <= 4/10). Questions least often answered correctly were identified.
Results
697 PCPs participated. For HPV infection, GPs and practice nurses answered a median of nine and seven questions correctly, respectively (p<0.001). Significantly associated with low HPV infection knowledge were: being a practice nurse/male GP; working fewer hours/ week; not having public patients; and having never taken a cervical smear. For HPV vaccination, both GPs and practice nurses answered a median of six questions correctly (p = 0.248). Significantly associated with low HPV vaccination knowledge were: being a practice nurse/male GP; working more years in general practice, fewer hours/week, in a smaller practice or in a practice not specialising in women's health; and having never taken a smear. Six HPV infection questions, and seven HPV vaccination questions, were not answered correctly by > of PCPs.
Conclusions
There are important limitations in HPV infection and vaccination knowledge among PCPs. By identifying factors associated with poor knowledge, and areas of particular uncertainty, these results can inform development of professional education initiatives thereby ensuring women have access to uniformly high-quality HPV-related information and advice.","McSherry, Lisa A.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Marine ecosystems are heavily influenced by a wide range of human-related impacts, and thus monitoring is essential to preserve and manage these sensitive habitats. Seabirds are considered important bioindicators of the oceans, but accessing breeding populations can be difficult, expensive and time consuming. New technologies have been employed to facilitate data collection on seabirds that can reduce costs and minimize disturbance. Among these, the use of time-lapse photography is a potentially effective way to reduce researcher effort, while collecting valuable information on key ecological parameters. However, the feasibility of this approach remains uncertain. Here, we assessed the use of time-lapse photography as a tool for estimating foraging behaviour from breeding seabirds, and evaluate ways forward for this method. We deployed cameras in front of active nests at a colony of black legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla) during two breeding seasons, 5 nests in 2013 and 5 in 2014, taking pictures every 4 minutes. A subsample of monitored individuals were also equipped with accelerometers. Approximately 100,000 frames, covering incubation and chick-rearing periods, were analysed. Estimates of foraging trip duration from images were positively correlated with accelerometry estimates (R-2 = 0.967). Equal partitioning of effort between pairs, predation events, nest attendance patterns and variation in trip metrics with breeding stage were also identified. Our results suggest that time-lapse photography is potentially a useful tool for assessing foraging trip duration and other fine-scale nesting ecology parameters as well as for assessing the effect of bio-logging devices on seabird foraging behaviour. Nevertheless, the time investment to manually extract data from images was high, and the process to set up cameras was not straightforward. To encourage wide use of time-lapse photography in seabird ecology, we thus provide guidelines for camera deployment and we suggest a need for further development of automated approaches to allow data extraction.","De Pascalis, Federico

"savedrecs (30).txt","Interactions between domestic and wild species has become a global problem of growing interest. Global Position Systems (GPS) allow collection of vast records of time series of animal spatial movement, but there is need for developing analytical methods to efficiently use this information to unravel species interactions. This study assesses different methods to infer interactions and their symmetry between individual animals, social groups or species. We used two data sets, (i) a simulated one of the movement of two grazing species under different interaction scenarios by-species and by-individual, and (ii) a real time series of GPS data on the movements of sheep and deer grazing a large moorland plot. Different time series transformations were applied to capture the behaviour of the data (convex hull area, km nearest neighbour distance, distance to centre of mass, Voronoi tessellation area, distance to past position) to assess their efficiency in inferring the interactions using different techniques (cross correlation, Granger causality, network properties). The results indicate that the methods are more efficient assessing by-group interaction than by-individual interaction, and different transformations produce different outputs of the nature of the interaction. Both species maintained a consistent by-species grouping structure. The results do not provide clear evidence of inter-species interaction based on the traditional framework of niche partitioning in the guild of large herbivores. In view of the transformation-dependent results, it seems that in our experimental framework both species co-exist showing complex interactions. We provide guidelines for the use of the different transformations with respect to study aims and data quality. The study attempts to provide behavioural ecologists with tools to infer animal interactions and their symmetry based on positional data recorded by visual observation, conventional telemetry or GPS technology.","Hollingdale, Edward

"savedrecs (30).txt","Active search for prey is energetically costly, so understanding how foragers optimize search has been central to foraging theory. Some theoretical work has suggested that foragers of randomly distributed prey should search using Levy flights, while work on area restricted and intermittent search strategies has demonstrated that foragers can use the information provided by prey encounters to more effectively adapt search direction and velocity. Previous empirical comparisons of these search modes have tended to rely on distribution -level analyses, due to the difficulty of collecting event-level data on encounters linked to the GPS tracks of foragers. Here we use a preliminary event-level data-set (18.7 hours of encounter-annotated focal follows over 6 trips) to show that two Colombian blowgun hunters use adaptive encounter-conditional heuristics, not non-conditional Levy flights, when searching for prey. Using a theoretically derived Bayesian model, we estimate changes in turning-angle and search velocity as a function of encounters with prey at lagged time-steps, and find that: 1) hunters increase average turning-angle in response to encounters, producing a more tortuous search of patches of higher prey density, but adopt more efficient uni-directional, inter-patch movement after failing to encounter prey over a sufficient period of time; and, 2) hunters reduce search velocity in response to encounters, causing them to spend more of their search time in patches with demonstrably higher prey density. These results illustrate the importance of using event-level data to contrast encounter-conditional, area-restricted search and Levy flights in explaining the search behavior of humans and other organisms.","Ross, Cody T.

"savedrecs (30).txt","In the past few years, miniature light-level geolocators have been developed for tracking wild bird species that were previously too small to track during their full annual cycle. Geolocators offer an exciting opportunity to study the full annual cycle for many species. However, the potential detrimental effects of carrying geolocators are still poorly understood, especially for small-bodied birds. Here, we deployed light-level geolocators on common yellow throat warblers (Geothlypis trichas). Over two years, we monitored return rates and neighborhood demography for 40 warblers carrying a geolocator and 20 reference birds that did not carry a geolocator. We compared the two groups with long-term data from 108 unmanipulated birds breeding at the same location in previous and subsequent years. Overall, we found that individuals carrying a geolocator were less likely to return to the study site in the following year (21% to 33% returned, depending on inclusion criteria) than either contemporaneous controls (55%) or long-term controls (55%). Among birds marked with geolocators, we also detected viability selection for greater wing length, whereas this pattern was not present in control birds. Finally, in each year after geolocator deployment, inexperienced breeders colonized vacant territories and this demographic effect persisted for two years after deployment. Sexual selection and ornamentation are strongly age-dependent in this system, and behavioral data collected after geolocator deployment is likely to differ systematically from natural conditions. Clearly geolocators will continue to be useful tools, but we suggest that future studies should carefully consider the potential for biased returns and the ecological validity of behavioral data collected from geolocator marked populations.","Taff, Conor C.

"savedrecs (30).txt","In a wide range of sexually reproducing marine organisms, males and females coexist through niche separation to reduce intraspecific competition and maximize survival; however, sexual segregation in mesopelagic cephalopods is poorly understood. To evaluate ontogenetic differences in diet and habitat partitioning between juvenile female and male jumbo squid Dosidicus gigas, we determined age and maturity, quantified stable isotope ratios along gladii bulk tissue and individual amino acids (AAs), and analyzed morphometrics of feeding apparatuses. D. gigas of 24 to 33 cm gladius length (GL) were collected in the northern Humboldt Current. Results showed that females had larger feeding apparatuses than males and higher delta N-15 values in bulk tissue and trophic AAs, but relatively similar source-AA delta N-15 values at same GLs. These results indicate that females catch prey of higher trophic position at earlier maturing stages than males, but tend to share similar habitat. This behavior likely reduces intraspecific competition, promotes ontogeny of sexual niche partitioning, and maximizes energy intake. Our study reveals that sexual segregation in feeding habits occurs in juvenile D. gigas during ontogenesis in the northern Humboldt Current, a strategy that can help elucidate its complex population dynamics and adaptation to fluctuating environmental conditions.","Gong, Yi

"savedrecs (30).txt","Studying the feeding ecology of seabirds is important not only to understand basic aspects of their ecology and threats but also for the conservation of marine ecosystems. In this regard, tropical seabirds have been relatively neglected, and in particular the trophic ecology of tropicbirds is scarcely known. We combined GPS tracking, environmental variables and sampling of regurgitates during incubation and brooding to understand the feeding ecology of red-billed tropicbirds Phaethon aethereus as well as how foraging strategies may change between 2 contrasting marine environments: a coastal island in the Canary Current upwelling (Iles de la Madeleine) and an oceanic island in the middle of the south Atlantic (St Helena). Tropicbirds breeding on the Iles de la Madeleine headed west, foraging on and beyond the shell slope, probably to associate with subsurface predators which bring pelagic fish close to the surface. Birds from St Helena showed a greater foraging effort and a strong attraction to areas with the greatest species richness of Scombridae, possibly due to a greater difficulty in finding prey in the oligotrophic oceanic waters. Tropicbirds ranged much beyond the extension of the protected areas around their colonies, indicating that current protected areas are insufficient for these populations. We found no evidence to suspect direct mortality of tropicbirds in regional fisheries, but over exploitation of small epipelagic fish and tuna may decrease feeding opportunities and lead to competition with fisheries. The substantial differences in foraging behaviour demonstrated by individuals from both colonies indicates that caution should be taken when extrapolating foraging patterns of tropical seabirds breeding in contrasting oceanographic environments.","Diop, Ngone

"savedrecs (30).txt","Movement within and between prey patches can influence the fitness of a predator, and understanding such foraging decisions is an important topic in ecology. Most research has found sustained foraging in dense prey patches but has focused on the movement of raptorial predators that feed on single prey items, or suspension-feeders foraging on comparatively immobile zooplankton. The goal of this study was to investigate the fine-scale movement of a suspension-feeding marine vertebrate species while foraging for mobile prey. Using animal-borne tags and surface observations, we analyzed the movement of foraging humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae within and among acoustically detected patches of sand lance Ammodytes spp. in the water column in the southern Gulf of Maine, USA. Analyzing data from 9 whales tagged between 2008 and 2012, we found hierarchical whale foraging movements that paralleled a complex, hierarchically structured prey landscape. For 7 out of 9 whales, feeding bout scales corresponded to prey patch scales. For 6 out of 9 whales, movement between sequential feeding events was not significantly different from distances between neighboring prey schools. Targeting neighboring schools during sequential feeding events, as opposed to sustained foraging in profitable patches, may increase foraging success in marine suspension-feeders targeting mobile prey, which confirms findings from many other marine predator taxa feeding on mobile prey species. Our study presents novel evidence for the high behavioral plasticity of an intermittent suspension-feeder targeting mobile prey, adapting its movement to the behavior of its prey and the structure of its prey field.","Kirchner, Theresa

"savedrecs (30).txt","Global Positioning System (GPS) technology is widely used in wildlife research to study animal movement and habitat use. In order to evaluate the quality and reliability of GPS data, the factors influencing the performance of these devices must be known, especially for semiaquatic species, because terrestrial and aquatic habitat might affect GPS performance differently. We evaluated the location error and fix success rate of three GPS receiver models in stationary tests and on a semi-aquatic mammal, the Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber). The location error during stationary tests was on average 15.7 m, and increased with increasing canopy closure, slope, and horizontal dilution of precision, potentially leading to the erroneous classification of GPS positions when studying habitat use in animals. In addition, the position of the GPS antenna (flat versus 90 degrees tilted) affected the location error, suggesting that animal behavior affects GPS performance. The fix success rate was significantly higher during stationary tests compared to when GPS units were deployed on beavers (94% versus 86%). Further, GPS receivers did not obtain any positions underwater and underground, the latter potentially allowing the estimation of activity periods in animals that use lodges or burrows as shelter. We discuss the possibilities for data screening, the use of buffer zones along the shoreline, and combination with other data loggers to avoid the erroneous classification of GPS positions when studying habitat use.","Justicia, Lia Schlippe

A cross-sectional study with a quantitative approach was performed at a reference center for the treatment of patients with hemoglobinopathies in northeastern Brazil. Patients were recruited between October 2015 and January 2017. Eligible participants answered a Physical Activity Questionnaire for Older Children and Adolescents (PAQ-C) and were instructed to use an ActiGraph wGT3X-BT triaxial accelerometer for seven consecutive days. Fifty patients (and their 50 controls matched for age and sex) were then evaluated. We observed lower moderate (19.2 +/- 11.9 and 27.1 +/- 13.8 min/d; p<0.01) and vigorous PA (3.6 +/- 4.1 and 7.8 +/- 7.4 min/d; p<0.01) in cases than controls, respectively. There was also a significant difference among cases and controls in the following variables: total of steps (51010 +/- 19600 and 59105 +/- 22650; p = 0.04) and ""total caloric expenditure"" (1015 +/- 516 and 2404 +/- 1308; p<0.01), with the lowest values for the patients with SCA for all variables. Children and adolescents with SCA presented lower levels of physical activity than healthy children and adolescents, either when evaluated by PAQs or by accelerometer.","Melo, Hugo Nivaldo

"savedrecs (30).txt","Background Identifying the factors that affect ranging behavior of animals is a central issue to ecology and an essential tool for designing effective conservation policies. This knowledge provides the information needed to predict the consequences of land-use change on species habitat use, especially in areas subject to major habitat transformations, such as agricultural landscapes. We evaluate inter-individual variation relative to environmental predictors and spatial constraints in limiting ranging behavior of female little bustards (Tetrax tetrax) in the non-breeding season. Our analyses were based on 11 females tracked with GPS during 5years in northeastern Spain. We conducted deviance partitioning analyses based on different sets of generalized linear mixed models constructed with environmental variables and spatial filters obtained by eigenvector mapping, while controlling for temporal and inter-individual variation.
Results The occurrence probability of female little bustards in response to environmental variables and spatial filters within the non-breeding range exhibited inter-individual consistency. Pure spatial factors and joint spatial-habitat factors explained most of the variance in the models. Spatial predictors representing aggregation patterns at similar to 18 km and 3-5 km respectively had a high importance in female occurrence. However, pure habitat effects were also identified. Terrain slope, alfalfa, corn stubble and irrigated cereal stubble availability were the variables that most contributed to environmental models. Overall, models revealed a non-linear negative effect of slope and positive effects of intermediate values of alfalfa and corn stubble availability. High levels of cereal stubble in irrigated land and roads had also a positive effect on occurrence at the population level.
Conclusions Our results provide evidence that female little bustard ranging behavior was spatially constrained beyond environmental variables during the non-breeding season. This pattern may result from different not mutually exclusive processes, such as cost-benefit balances of animal movement, configurational heterogeneity of environment or from high site fidelity and conspecific attraction. Measures aimed at keeping alfalfa availability and habitat heterogeneity in open landscapes and flat terrains, in safe places close to breeding grounds, could contribute to protect little bustard populations during the non-breeding season.","Cusco, Francesc

"savedrecs (30).txt","Large herbivores display restricted area searching and, therefore, in food-rich patches, animals should spend more time feeding, move slowly, and take tortuous movement paths. Intersexual differences in social behavior might disrupt restricted area searching that, in turn, might affect ecological differences between size-dimorphic females and males. We measured time the head was up (head up), step lengths (m/min), and tortuosity of foraging paths in 547 focal observations in a nomnigratory population of Roosevelt elk (Cervus elaphus roosevelti) in Redwood National and State Parks, California, United States. Focal observations were 4-15 min in length. Head up was positively related to proximity (within 1 body length of other elk) for females and males but the slope was steeper for males. When males were aggregated with females, head up was more elevated than when males were aggregated with other males. Sex-specific social behaviors did not influence step length and foraging path tortuosity. Social behavior disrupted efficient foraging. Connecting social behavior to foraging behavior can help explain the numerous ways that size-dimorphic females and males display ecological differences.","Peterson, Leah M.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Monitoring small groups of sheep in spontaneous evolution in the field, we decipher behavioural rules that sheep follow at the individual scale in order to sustain collective motion. Individuals alternate grazing mode at null speed and moving mode at walking speed, so cohesive motion stems from synchronising when they decide to switch between the two modes. We propose a model for the individual decision making process, based on switching rates between stopped /walking states that depend on behind/ahead locations and states of the others. We parametrize this model from data. Next, we translate this (microscopic) individual-based model into its density-flow (macroscopic) equations counterpart. Numerical solving these equations display a traveling pulse propagating at constant speed even though each individual is at any moment either stopped or walking. Considering the minimal model embedded in these equations, we derive analytically the steady shape of the pulse (sech square). The parameters of the pulse (shape and speed) are expressed as functions of individual parameters. This pulse emerges from the non linear coupling of start/stop individual decisions which compensate exactly for diffusion and promotes a steady ratio of walking/stopped individuals, which in turn determines the traveling speed of the pulse. The system seems to converge to this pulse from any initial condition, and to recover the pulse after perturbation. This gives a high robustness to this coordination mechanism.","Azais, Manon

"savedrecs (30).txt","Background: Fishing activities can influence foraging behaviour of many seabird species worldwide. Seabirds are attracted by fishing vessels which can facilitate access to demersal fish as a novel food resource that otherwise would be unavailable. On the other hand, intense fishing activities cause depletion of fish stocks with a reduction of natural prey available for seabirds. Moreover, fisheries discards can have lower nutritional value than natural prey. However, the importance of fisheries discard for seabirds and the possible implications on their foraging ecology is still poorly understood. In this study, we analysed the interactions of Scopoli's shearwaters (Calonectris diomedea) during their foraging trips with fishing vessels. We combined the GPS and accelerometer data of shearwaters with the GPS data gathered during the same period from fishing vessels. Accelerometers allowed us to identify the main behaviours of birds.
Results: The presence of fishing vessels significantly affected the individual behaviourofScopoli's shearwaters. Birds increased the time spent sitting on the water within 1.280 +/- 13 km of fishing vessels likely feeding or waiting for discards. Approaches towards vessels within the interaction distance were therefore classified as an interaction and were recorded in about 40% of individuals. Birds interacting with fisheries had longer flight time during their foraging trips and covered longer distances to reach more distant foraging areas compared with individuals not approaching vessels.
Conclusions: Our results suggested that fisheries discard consumption might not be a profitable source of food for Scopoli's shearwaters. Despite the high density of fishing vessels in the home range of Scopoli's shearwater, most individuals did not interact with them. Accordingly, scavenging individuals showed a lower foraging efficiency than their conspecifics. Intraspecific competition for foraging areas might play an important role for the foragingdecision of birds to consume fisheries discards.","Cianchetti-Benedetti, M.

"savedrecs (30).txt","In persons with disabilities, the accuracy of self-report data collection methods in travel behavior studies may be influenced by disease-related dysfunctions. The present study determines in detail whether disease-related physical, cognitive or psychosocial impairments contribute to the reporting rate of subjective self-report travel diaries and objective GPS tracking devices, besides socio-demographic and trip-related characteristics. The reporting rate of both data collection methods was analyzed in 108 persons with Multiple Sclerosis with various disability severities during a seven-day data collection period. The results demonstrated that there was only limited influence of disease-related dysfunctions on the reporting rate of both data collection methods, as well as only limited significant differences between subgroups with various disability severity. Overall, the data quality of the diary was higher than the quality of the GPS data: 66% of the trips were reported in both data collection methods, while overall more than one fifth of all trips were forgotten and not registered by GPS, and 11% were forgotten and not reported in the diary. Self-report travel diaries seemed to be more suitable for persons with a higher disability severity, as these persons more often forgot to take their GPS device with them when making a trip because of several organiza-tional issues related to their mobility limitations.","Neven, An

"savedrecs (30).txt","GPS-equipped smartphones provide new methods to collect data about travel behavior, including travel survey apps that incorporate automated location sensing. Previous approaches to this have involved proprietary or one-off tools that are inconsistent and difficult to evaluate. In contrast, e-mission is an open-source, extensible software platform that consists of (a) an app for survey participants to install on their Android or iOS smartphones and (b) cloud-hosted software for managing the collected data. e-mission collects continuous location data, user-initiated annotations, and responses to contextual, platform initiated survey questions. New studies can be set up using the existing University of California, Berkeley, infrastructure with no additional coding, or the platform can be extended for more complex projects. This paper reviews the requirements for smartphone travel data collection, describes the architecture and capabilities of the e-mission platform, and evaluates its performance in a pilot deployment. The results show that the platform is usable, with over 150 installations in a month; stable, with over 85% of users retaining it for more than 3 days; and extensible, with interface and survey customizations accomplished in a little over a week of full-time work by a transportation engineering researcher. We hope that e-mission will be a useful tool for app-based data collection and will serve as a catalyst for related research.","Shankari, K.

"savedrecs (30).txt","The need for developing reliable and rigorous models that can replicate and make predictions of pedestrian crowd evacuations has necessitated an understanding of the impact of architecture on individuals' interactions with their surroundings and the behavioral rules that govern their movements. Due to the challenges of providing such behavioral data from natural evacuations and previous crowd incidents, simulation-based and laboratory-based evacuation experiments have recently been employed as innovative data-provision approaches to study crowd behavior notably under emergency conditions. This study explores pioneer experiments of emergency escape with a view to investigating the relationship between spatial constraints and collective behavior of human crowds. Here, we make use of two types of empirical and analytical data obtained from a large number of well-controlled laboratory and evacuation simulation experiments. This study presents findings corresponding to how and to what extent the presence of conflicting layouts in egress areas, particularly merging corridors, affect the collective motion of pedestrians. The focus of attention will be on measures of performance at macroscopic level derived from both observations. Our results suggested that the movement patterns observed in both types of experiments are sensitive to the angle between the two merging streams and the symmetry/asymmetry of the merging layouts, with symmetric layouts almost invariably outperforming the asymmetric counterparts. Also, within each symmetry/asymmetry structural type, the angle at which the flows combined with each other affected the efficiency of discharge. Our findings provide further evidence as to the significant role of the architectural structure of the movement area in facilitating the traffic flow of heavy crowds of pedestrians.","Shahhoseini, Zahra

"savedrecs (30).txt","The increasing occurrence of safety-related incidents like fire and terror attacks in crowded public facilities and mass gatherings has heightened the importance of planning for efficient evacuations through optimizing evacuation routes and architectural designs. This calls for the development of simulation and analytical tools that can replicate occupants' responses and thereby their most likely movement patterns. Such models must be accurate to prevent inappropriate design and planning. One major factor connected to prediction accuracy is the sensitivity of modeling outputs to the value of their various parameters. We report on implementation of a calibrated model of directional choices in a microscopic simulation model of pedestrians' evacuation. We show how estimates of the aggregate measures of prediction are sensitive to the parameters of this tactical level (i.e., directional choice) model. Results demonstrate that the prediction of the total evacuation time and average individual evacuation times are closely correlated with one another in terms of their variation, and are both very sensitive to the specification of each directional choice parameter. Simulated evacuation time could vary up to nearly 30% depending on parameter values. The observed sensitivity highlighted the significance of importing well-calibrated parameters into such simulation models and practicing consistent degrees of accuracy for all levels of decision modeling. We also inferred that the two aggregate measures (i.e., total evacuation time and average individual evacuation times) can be used interchangeably as the basis for evacuation optimization or sensitivity analysis practices.","Haghani, Milad

"savedrecs (30).txt","Car-following models, as the essential part of traffic microscopic simulations, have been utilized to analyze and estimate longitudinal drivers' behavior for sixty years. The conventional car-following models use mathematical formulas to replicate human behavior in car-following phenomenon. The incapability of these approaches to capture the complex interactions between vehicles calls for deploying advanced learning frameworks to consider more detailed behavior of drivers. In this study, we apply the gradient boosting of regression tree (GBRT) algorithm to vehicle trajectory data sets, which have been collected through the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) program, to develop a new car-following model. First, the regularization parameters of the proposed method are tuned using cross-validation technique and sensitivity analysis. Second, prediction performance of the GBRT is compared to the world-famous Gazis-Herman-Rothery (GHR) model, when both models have been trained on the same data sets. The estimation results of the models on unseen records indicate the superiority of the GBRT algorithm in capturing the motion characteristics of two successive vehicles.","Dabiri, Sina

"savedrecs (30).txt","Foraging techniques influence the morphological peculiarities and ecological specialization of species, also determining their organization in a community. The foraging behavior of forest ground insectivorous birds remains the least explored due to the difficulty of observing them in the wild. We studied the foraging behavior of four nightingale species in an outdoor aviary where they were given a choice of typical foraging substrates. Two categories of young birds took part in the experiment: hand-raised and wild birds. Five aspects of behavior were recorded: foraging intensity, structure of background activity, attack maneuvers, attack direction, and substrate preference. The coefficients for converting the noted activity into energy expenditure units were developed. The behavioral parameters, except for the intensity of foraging, were expressed as the proportion of total energy expenditure for a given behavioral aspect, reducing the variation of these parameters related to a change in activity. Three principal components explain more than three-quarters of the interspecific differences in individual behavioral parameters. The first component corresponds to the foraging intensity and ranks the species according to decreasing body mass. The second component distinguishes the tactics of the Siberian Rubythroat as complex exploration of dense vegetation thickets from the tactics of the Rufous-tailed Robin as detailed extensive ground surface exploration. The third component contrasts the tactics of the Bluethroat (alternation of moving, waiting, and long sally-hovers) to the tactics of the Siberian Blue Robin (intensive short aerial attacks). The species-specific foraging traits appear in young birds independently of the wildlife experience. While learning by doing, they increase the foraging intensity and strengthen specific behavioral traits. The type of substrate determined the foraging intensity and ratio of the expenditure for search, movement, and attacks. Foraging techniques and their direction are correlated with other behavioral aspects, but are partly determined by the preference of specific preys and their properties. Despite the well-marked distinctions, the foraging niches of the nightingales strongly overlap; i.e., each behavioral aspect of the species studied is dominated by basic, less specialized elements.","Bourski, O.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Chiroptera is the order of the only mammals to have acquired flapping flight. Their musculoskeletal system is significantly reorganized. In addition, their four-legged locomotion is fundamentally different from that in typical mammals. The most up-to-date information on the terrestrial locomotion concerns the species expressing this type of movement as an integrated component of foraging behavior. Quadrupedal locomotion of other bats remains practically unstudied. This paper presents the results of experimental analysis of four-legged terrestrial locomotion in five species of vespertilionid bats. The study is based on a combination of two methods: two-angle high-speed video recording and animals' trackways and traces analysis. The temporal, metric, and speed parameters for locomotion in different species are estimated. The dependence of the characteristics between each other is proven. This is the first time that such parameters have been studied in Chiroptera. A diagonal symmetry for the pattern of the sequential movement of limbs has been detected, while it involves a wide range of deviations atypical for quadrupedal vertebrates.","Emelianova, O. R.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Natterer's bat Myotis nattereri is one of the least known European bats. Understanding its patterns of movement between roosts is an important aspect of assessing the relative value of different types of roost for conservation of the species. We determined patterns of movement of Natterer's bat between roosts by radio-tracking successive animals from the same colonies during summer (May to September). For one maternity colony comprising 65 adult females, the attic of a large mediaeval church was the main roost site, accounting for 88% of radio-located bat days. The two other maternity colonies tracked comprised about 35 adult females each and used from 15 to 25 roost sites, some containing multiple roosts. For these two colonies, up to six roost sites per colony accounted for about 80% of bat occupancy days in any one summer and for each colony, roost home ranges for roosts used by subgroups of at least two bats together covered 0.4 km(2). Although bats made frequent movements between roosts there was no apparent interchange between adjacent colonies and no overlap in the range used by adjacent colonies. Bats changed roosts every 3.0 days on average, moving 510 m (median) to an alternative roost. They departed late and returned early to roosts. Colonies assembled or disintegrated into larger or smaller groups occupying diverse roosts during summer, but there was high social cohesion between colony members. Bats that separated into subgroups from mid-summer (mid-July) onwards later roosted together again. Natterer's bat exhibits high behavioural flexibility in the type of roosts used: of two adjacent maternity colonies, one used mostly tree roosts and the other mostly buildings. However, both roosted mainly in roofs during early summer (late May to mid-July). Tree roosts were significantly preferred to those in buildings when ambient external maximum temperatures were >= 30 degrees C or mean temperatures fell below 14 degrees C. Natterer's bat appears to depend on the availability of a number of roosts of different types. Parturition roosts, roosts in heavily timbered barns and roosts within core roosting areas, potentially up to 1.2 km distant from the parturition roost, should have highest conservation priority but conservation management should guard against any roost loss.","Smith, Peter G.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Tidepool sculpins (Oligocottus maculosus) have been observed moving overland in the rocky intertidal, and we documented the terrestrial walking behavior that they use to accomplish this. We quantified the terrestrial movements of O. maculosus and compared them to (1) their aquatic locomotion, (2) terrestrial locomotion of closely-related subtidal species (Leptocottus armatus and Icelinus borealis), and (3) terrestrial movements of walking catfishes (Clarias spp.). We recorded sculpin movements (210 fps) on a terrestrial platform and in a water tank and tracked body landmarks for kinematic analysis. The axial-appendage-based terrestrial locomotion of O. maculosus is driven by cyclic lateral oscillations of the tail, synchronized with alternating rotations about the base of the pectoral fins, a behavior that appears similar to a military ""army crawl."" The pectoral fins do not provide propulsion, but act as stable points for the body to rotate around. In contrast, individuals of O. maculosus use primarily axial undulation during slow-speed swimming. The army crawl is a more effective terrestrial behavior (greater distance ratio) than the movements produced by L. armatus and I. borealis, which use rapid, cyclic oscillations of the tail, without coordinated pectoral fin movements. Relative to Clarias spp., O. maculosus rotated the body about the base of the pectoral fin, rather than the tip of the fin, which may cause O. maculosus to have a lower distance ratio. Since O. maculosus lack major morphological adaptations for terrestrial locomotion, instead relying on behavioral adaptations, we propose behavioral adaptations may evolutionarily predate morphological adaptations for terrestrial locomotion in vertebrates.","Bressman, Noah R.

"savedrecs (30).txt","With amphibian declines at crisis levels, translocations, including population augmentations, are commonly used for amphibian conservation. Eastern Hellbenders (Cryptobranchus alleganiensis alleganiensis) have declined to low densities in many areas of their range, making them ideal candidates for population augmentation. Both wild adults and captive-reared juveniles have been used for augmentations, but their suitability has never been directly compared. Herein, we use radio telemetry with Eastern Hellbenders to examine patterns of site fidelity, movement, and habitat use over a 2-yr period for adult residents, wild adult translocates, and captive-reared juvenile translocates. We used generalized linear models and generalized linear mixed models to identify temporal trends and explore the effects of residential status (resident vs. translocate) and origin/age (captive-reared juveniles vs. wild adults) on various ecological and behavioral traits relating to habitat. Site fidelity was high in adult residents and wild adult translocates, but lower in captive-reared juvenile translocates. Both adult and juvenile translocates had greater mean movement distances than residents, leading to larger home range sizes, but these differences decreased over time. Wild adult translocates had a higher probability of using artificial nest rocks than adult residents or captive-reared juvenile translocates. This pattern was most prevalent early in the study, indicating these shelters are particularly useful during the transition to release sites. Captive-reared juvenile translocates had lower site fidelity and utilized suboptimal habitat (smaller and fewer shelter rocks) compared to wild adults. Compared to previous studies, translocations had fewer negative effects on site residents or wild translocates and might be effective at promoting growth of Hellbender populations. However, translocations of captive-reared juveniles were less successful. As we are uncertain whether captive-rearing or ontogeny led to these differences, both longer head-starting times and conditioning should be explored to improve outcomes in captive-reared juvenile cohorts.","McCallen, Emily B.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Objective: To investigate the magnitude of postural sway induced by different balance tasks in adolescents with concussion and to examine the associations of postural sway with concussion symptoms.
Design: Cross-sectional study.
Patients or Other Participants: Fifty-six adolescents (20 girls, 36 boys) between 13 and 17 years of age who sustained a concussion within the past 44 days and were still symptomatic.
Main Outcome Measure(s): Anterior-posterior postural sway was measured using an accelerometer attached to the participant's lower back while he or she performed 6 static-balance tasks that varied the visual input, type of surface, and foot stance. Participants self-reported symptoms that occurred at the time of the concussion (eg, dizziness, confusion, amnesia) as well as at the time of balance testing (eg, eye and head movement-induced dizziness).
Results: The normalized path length of postural sway during the different balance tasks was greater with the eyes closed (mean = 19.3 mG/s) compared with the eyes open (mean = 12.4 mG/s; P < .001). Furthermore, sway while standing with the feet together on a foam surface (mean = 17.9 mG/s) or while tandem standing on a firm surface (mean = 19.4 mG/s) was greater than sway while standing with the feet together on a firm surface (mean = 10.3 mG/s; P < .001).Greater sway was associated with dizziness and confusion reported at the time of injury (P < .05).Dizziness and headache symptoms at rest were positively correlated with sway (P < .05).
Conclusions: Using accelerometers to measure postural sway during different challenging balance conditions in adolescents with concussion may provide an objective means of quantifying balance impairments in clinical environments. Furthermore, the association of these measurements with symptoms suggests a need to account for symptom severity at the time of testing.","Alkathiry, Abdulaziz A.

The Reddish Egret is also a habitat specialist, and is restricted to shallow, coastal wetlands throughout its range. We utilized GPS-equipped platform terminal transmitters to examine the breeding ecology of Reddish Egrets (n = 28) in Texas. Although individuals exhibited varying degrees of fidelity to specific colonies, there was fidelity to particular areas within the Laguna Madre, Texas, across years. Reddish Egrets also exhibited fidelity to foraging areas across years and selected nonvegetated tidal flats as foraging habitat. Long-distance migrants began the breeding season two weeks later than residents on average; however, the timing of breeding did not appear to influence nest success. We also found that the amount of available foraging habitat within 15 km of the colony was associated with the abundance of Reddish Egret breeding pairs at colonies.","Koczur, Lianne M.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Green turtles (Chelonia mydas) are observed year-round in the Sea of Jeju Island, Republic of Korea; however, there is limited information on their migration and seasonal distribution outside of Korean waters. To investigate their spatial and temporal movement, we tracked 8 green turtles (straight carapace length range, 49.7-85.9 cm; mean +/- SD, 63.36 +/- 10.99 cm), taken as bycatch in pound nets near Jeju Island, using satellite transmitters from August 2015 to January 2017. Turtles were mainly juveniles and were tracked for 17-314 d. Three turtles traveled more than 400 km from their release site in 2 different directions: one individual moved westward to China within 17 d of release, and 2 individuals traveled eastward to Japan. One turtle that moved to Japan had been flipper-tagged at Kagoshima, Japan, 1 mo prior to its capture at Jeju Island. The other 5 individuals remained near the coast of Jeju Island. The individual tracked for the longest period (314 d) overwintered (water temperature, 12 degrees-14 degrees C) in the eastern area of Jeju Island. These results indicate that green turtles from different regions, including China and Japan, may use the areas around Jeju Island for foraging, for overwintering, and/or as a migratory corridor. To fortify the conservation of green turtles in the region, international cooperation and expanded research efforts, such as genetic studies, are needed.","Jang, Soojin

The predictive system is widely used especially in marketing, retailing and product development. The system responds to users preferences in goods and services and gives recommendations via Machine Learning algorithms deployed catered specifically for such services. The same recommender system can be built for predicting botnets attack. Via our Integrated Cyber-Evidence (ICE) Big Data system, we build a recommender system based on collected data on telemetric Botnets networks traffics. The recommender system is trained periodically on cyber-threats enriched data from Coordinated Malware Eradication & Remedial Platform system (CMERP), specifically the geolocations and the timestamp of the attacks. The machine learning is based on K-Means and DBSCAN clustering. The result is a recommendation of top potential attacks based on ranks from a given geolocations coordinates. The recommendation also includes alerts on locations with high density of certain botnets types.","Zamani, Nazri Ahmad

"savedrecs (30).txt","Satellite and GPS transmitters provide valuable information for bird conservation, though their attachment may have behavioral and/or physical effects. Captive Lesser Adjutant Storks (Leptoptilos javanicus) in Cambodia were divided into a control group (n = 7) and an experimental group (n = 7), and their behavior was monitored during three periods of 22 days each. The experimental group was fitted with dummy backpack transmitters in the second period. Each group included one individual capable of flight (n= 2); all other individuals had the feather vanes of one wing dipped. Both groups interacted by pulling, nibbling or pecking on their own or another bird's transmitter (6.8% of the total interaction time in the experimental group, < 1% in the control group). One individual capable of flight had a skin abrasion when removing the tag, which was likely caused by a tight fit of the backpack rather than its flying ability. The experimental group showed significantly more reflex movements (e.g., sneezing, yawning) in the third period (P= 0.017), but outside factors were assumed to have caused this difference. Despite measurable transmitter effects, no evidence was found that the birds' wellbeing was affected. This study provides a safe transmitter attachment method for Lesser Adjutants that aids future conservation.","Mielke, Lara

"savedrecs (30).txt","The influence of an unusual concentration of sea ice and breeding failure on the foraging movement patterns and habitat use of Great Black-backed Gulls (Larus marinas) was investigated. GPS loggers were deployed on three incubating females when multi-year sea ice moved into foraging ranges, dividing the tracking period (1-23 June 2017) into ice-free (5-10 days) and ice-present periods (11-12 days). Foraging trip parameters (e.g., distance, duration) differed among individuals but not with ice conditions. Great Black-backed Gulls decreased use of islands when ice was present (0.05 +/- 0.08 locations/trip) relative to absent (5.9 +/- 0.5 locations/trip), but increased use of marine habitat when ice was present (9.4 +/- 0.2 locations/trip) relative to absent (2.9 +/- 0.2 locations/trip). Great Black-backed Gulls also moved at higher speeds in areas of 91-100% ice cover relative to < 50% ice cover, suggesting that low percent cover sea ice acts as important at-sea foraging/roosting sites. Additionally, two Great Black-backed Gulls that were continuously tracked during post-breeding failure repeatedly visited the colony throughout July-August, suggesting some advantage to maintaining a presence at nest sites.","Maynard, Laurie D.

"savedrecs (30).txt","The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of different pitch surfaces (artificial turf, natural turf and dirt field) on positioning and displacement of young soccer players (age: 13.4 +/- 0.5 yrs; body height: 161.82 +/- 7.52 cm; body mass: 50.79 +/- 7.22 kg and playing experience: 3.5 +/- 1.4 yrs). Data were collected using GPS units which allowed to calculate spatial distribution variability, assessed by measuring entropy of individual distribution maps (ShannEn). Ellipsoidal areas (m2) representing players' displacement on the pitch, centred on the average players' positional coordinates, were also calculated, with axes corresponding to the standard deviations of the displacement in the longitudinal and lateral directions. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate differences between pitch surfaces and across players' positions. There was significant effect in positioning (eta 2 = 0.146; p < 0.001) and displacement (eta 2 = 0.063; p < 0.05) by the players between pitch surfaces. A dirt field condition induced an increase in the players' movement variability, while players' displacement was more restricted when playing on artificial turf. Also, there were significant effects on positioning (eta 2 = 0.496; p < 0.001) and displacement (eta 2 = 0.339; p < 0.001) across players' positions. Central midfielders presented the greatest movement variability and displacement while fullbacks showed the lowest variability. Subsequently, the results may contribute to implement strategies that optimise players' performance in different surface conditions.","Brito, Angelo

"savedrecs (30).txt","Natal dispersal is an important mechanism for the viability of populations. The influence of local conditions or experience gained in the natal habitat could improve fitness if dispersing individuals settle in an area with similar habitat characteristics. This process, defined as 'natal habitat-biased dispersal' (NHBD), has been used to explain distribution patterns in large carnivores, but actual studies evaluating it are rare. We tested whether grey wolf Canis lupus territory establishment was influenced by the habitat characteristics of the natal territory using the long-term monitoring of the Scandinavian wolf population. We paired the locations of natal and established territories, accounted for available habitats along the dispersing route, and compared their habitat characteristics for 271 wolves during 1998-2012. Wolves with the shortest dispersal distances established in natal-like habitat types more than expected by chance, whereas wolves that dispersed longer distances did not show NHBD. The pattern was consistent for male and female wolves, with females showing more NHBD than males. Chances to detect NHBD increased with the size of habitat defined as available. This highlights the importance of considering the biological characteristics of the studied species when defining habitat availability.","Sanz-Perez, Ana

"savedrecs (30).txt","Despite the frequency with whiCh mixed-species groups are observed in nature, studies of collective behaviour typically focus on single-species groups. Here, we quantify and compare the patterns of interactions between three fish species, threespine sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus), ninespine sticklebacks (Pungitius pungitius) and roach (Rutilus rutilus) in both single and mixed-species shoals in the laboratory. Pilot data confirmed that the three species form both single- and mixed-species shoals in the wild. In our laboratory study, we found that single-species groups were more polarized than mixed-species groups, while single-species groups of threespine sticklebacks and roach were more cohesive than mixed shoals of these species. Furthermore, while there was no difference between the inter-individual distances between threespine and ninespine sticklebacks within mixed-species groups, there was some evidence of segregation by species in mixed groups of threespine sticklebacks and roach. There were differences between treatments in mean pairwise transfer entropy, and in particular we identify species-differences in information use within the mixed-species groups, and, similarly, differences in responses to conspecifics and heterospecifics in mixed-species groups. We speculate that differences in the patterns of interactions between species in mixed-species groups may determine patterns of fission and fusion in such groups.","Ward, Ashley J. W.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Walleye Sander vitreus is a popular species for catch-and-release angling tournaments in North America, but we currently know little about the postrelease behavior of this species and the congeneric Sauger S. canadensis. We used radiotelemetry and acoustic telemetry to track Walleyes (n=101) and Saugers (n=19) for 7d after release at tournaments in Saskatchewan. Our objectives were to provide a description of postrelease movements, and examine the influence of handling variables and stress scores on movement. Walleyes made highly variable movements over 7d, and total dispersal ranged from less than 100m to over 28km from the release point. Path lengthsthe cumulative distance between start and end pointswere considerably longer than straight-line dispersal. Walleyes made larger movements than Saugers, with average total dispersal values of 6.1 +/- 6.9km (mean +/- SD) and 1.3 +/- 1.8km, respectively. Multivariate modeling revealed that species and tournament were the only important factors affecting movement. Fish size (TL), capture depth, distance transported, and time spent in a live well were not consistently important predictors of postrelease movement. Walleyes and Saugers moved much smaller distances when they had poor outcomes for the reflex action mortality predictor (RAMP) test, but RAMP scores in general did not explain a significant proportion of the variance in any fish movement metric. Swim scores at the time of release, an alternative metric of stress, also did not explain a significant proportion of variance in fish movement. Our results show intriguing variance in the behavioral response of individual Walleyes and Saugers to catch and release at tournaments, but do not identify causal factors.","Eberts, Rebecca L.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Background: Global positioning system (GPS) based player movement tracking data are widely used by professional football (soccer) clubs and academies to provide insight into activity demands during training and competitive matches. However, the use of movement tracking data to inform the design of training programmes is still an open research question. Objectives: The objective of this study is to analyse player tracking data to understand activity level differences between training and match sessions, with respect to different playing positions. Methods: This study analyses the per-session summary of historical movement data collected through GPS tracking to profile high-speed running activity as well as distance covered during training sessions as a whole and competitive matches. We utilise 20,913 data points collected from 53 football players aged between 18 and 23 at an elite football academy across four full seasons (2014-2018). Through ANOVA analysis and probability distribution analysis, we compare the activity demands, measured by the number of high-speed runs, the amount of high-speed distance, and distance covered by players in key playing positions, such as Central Midfielders, Full Backs, and Centre Forwards. Results and Implications: While there are significant positional differences in physical activity demands during competitive matches, the physical activity levels during training sessions do not show positional variations. In matches, the Centre Forwards face the highest demand for High Speed Runs (HSRs), compared to Central Midfielders and Full Backs. However, on average the Central Midfielders tend to cover more distance than Centre Forwards and Full Backs. An increase in high-speed work demand in matches and training over the past four seasons, also shown by a gradual change in the extreme values of high-speed running activity, was also found. This large-scale, longitudinal study makes an important contribution to the literature, providing novel insights from an elite performance environment about the relationship between player activity levels during training and match play, and how these vary by playing position.","De Silva, Varuna

"savedrecs (30).txt","The social transmission of information is critical to the emergence of animal culture. Two processes are predicted to play key roles in how socially-transmitted information spreads in animal populations: the movement of individuals across the landscape and conformist social learning. We develop a model that, for the first time, explicitly integrates these processes to investigate their impacts on the spread of behavioural preferences. Our results reveal a strong interplay between movement and conformity in determining whether locally-variable traditions establish across a landscape or whether a single preference dominates the whole population. The model is able to replicate a real-world cultural diffusion experiment in great tits Parus major, but also allows for a range of predictions for the emergence of animal culture under various initial conditions, habitat structure and strength of conformist bias to be made. Integrating social behaviour with ecological variation will be important for understanding the stability and diversity of culture in animals.","Somveille, Marius

"savedrecs (30).txt","In human motion science, accelerometers are used as linear distance sensors by attaching them to moving body parts, with their measurement axes aligned in the direction of motion. When double integrating the raw sensor data, multiple error sources are also integrated, producing inaccuracies in the final position estimation which increases fast with the integration time. In this paper, we make a systematic and experimental comparison of different methods for position estimation, with different sensors and in different motion conditions. The objective is to correlate practical factors that appear in real applications, such as motion mean velocity, path length, calibration method, or accelerometer noise level, with the quality of the estimation. The results confirm that it is possible to use accelerometers to estimate short linear displacements of the body with a typical error of around 4.5% in the general conditions tested in this study. However, they also show that the motion kinematic conditions can be a key factor in the performance of this estimation, as the dynamic response of the accelerometer can affect the final results. The study lays out the basis for a better design of distance estimations, which are useful in a wide range of ambulatory human motion monitoring applications.","Carlos Alvarez, Juan

"savedrecs (30).txt","Several studies have analyzed human gait data obtained from inertial gyroscope and accelerometer sensors mounted on different parts of the body. In this article, we take a step further in gait analysis and provide a methodology for predicting the movements of the legs, which can be applied in prosthesis to imitate the missing part of the leg in walking. In particular, we propose a method, called GaIn, to control non-invasive, robotic, prosthetic legs. GaIn can infer the movements of both missing shanks and feet for humans suffering from double trans-femoral amputation using biologically inspired recurrent neural networks. Predictions are performed for casual walking related activities such as walking, taking stairs, and running based on thigh movement. In our experimental tests, GaIn achieved a 4.55 degrees prediction error for shank movements on average. However, a patient's intention to stand up and sit down cannot be inferred from thigh movements. In fact, intention causes thigh movements while the shanks and feet remain roughly still. The GaIn system can be triggered by thigh muscle activities measured with electromyography (EMG) sensors to make robotic prosthetic legs perform standing up and sitting down actions. The GaIn system has low prediction latency and is fast and computationally inexpensive to be deployed on mobile platforms and portable devices.","Chereshnev, Roman

"savedrecs (30).txt","Statistical analysis of accidents in recent years shows that crowd crushes have become significant non-combat, non-environmental public disasters. Unlike common accidents such as fires, crowd crushes may occur without obvious external causes, and may arise quickly and unexpectedly in otherwise normal surroundings. We use physics-based simulations to understand the processes and consequences of compressive forces on high density static crowds consisting of up to 400 agents in a restricted space characterized by barriers to free movement. According to empirical observation and experimentation by others, we know that local high packing density is an important factor leading to crowd crushes and consequent injuries. We computationally verify our hypothesis that compressive forces create high local crowd densities which exceed human tolerance. Affected agents may thus be unable to move or escape and will present additional movement obstacles to others. Any high density crowd simulation should therefore take into account these possible negative effects on crowd mobility and behavior. Such physics-based simulations may therefore assist in the design of crowded spaces that could reduce the possibility of crushes and their consequences.","Sun, Libo

"savedrecs (30).txt","Simple Summary Behaviour that indicates stress or poor welfare in horses can be very subtle and, especially for the lay person, difficult to assess. Furthermore, the absence of such behaviour does not necessarily indicate a healthy mental state. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate whether a preference for the left or right forelimb in different tasks (motor laterality) or for left or right sensory organs (sensory laterality) indicates a positive mental state (positive cognitive biasoptimism) or negative mental state (negative cognitive biaspessimism). This study demonstrates that horses that use the right forelimb more often when starting to move off from a standing position (initial forelimb use) are more likely to expect a neutral stimulus to be positive and to be in an optimistic mental state than horses that use the left forelimb. This knowledge about the horses' mental state can help us to improve their welfare by minimizing negative events. Furthermore, evaluation of the mental state of animals by determining motor laterality is quicker and easier than conventional tests for cognitive bias that include a long period of training.
Abstract An individual's positive or negative perspective when judging an ambiguous stimulus (cognitive bias) can be helpful when assessing animal welfare. Emotionality, as expressed in approach or withdrawal behaviour, is linked to brain asymmetry. The predisposition to process information in the left or right brain hemisphere is displayed in motor laterality. The quality of the information being processed is indicated by the sensory laterality. Consequently, it would be quicker and more repeatable to use motor or sensory laterality to evaluate cognitive bias than to perform the conventional judgment bias test. Therefore, the relationship between cognitive bias and motor or sensory laterality was tested. The horses (n = 17) were trained in a discrimination task involving a box that was placed in either a positive or negative location. To test for cognitive bias, the box was then placed in the middle, between the trained positive and negative location, in an ambiguous location, and the latency to approach the box was evaluated. Results indicated that horses that were more likely to use the right forelimb when moving off from a standing position were more likely to approach the ambiguous box with a shorter latency (generalized linear mixed model, p < 0.01), and therefore displayed a positive cognitive bias (optimistic).","Marr, Isabell

The PetPace Smart-collar is a non-invasive wireless collar that collects important health markers, including heart beats, variation in the intervals between heartbeats, breaths per minute, and position data (lying, sitting, standing), in addition to activity. The purpose of this study was to determine whether combining data from the Actigraph monitor and PetPace collar would provide reliable pulse, respiration, and heart rate variability results during various activity levels in dogs, and whether these variables were affected by the absence or presence of their caretakers.
Abstract Although several studies have examined the effects of an owner's absence and presence on a dog's physiological responses under experimental conditions over short periods of time (minutes), little is known about the effects of proximity between humans and freely moving dogs under natural conditions over longer periods of time (days). The first aim of our study was to determine whether the combined data generated from the PetPace Collar and Actigraph Link accelerometer provide reliable pulse, respiration, and heart rate variability results during sedentary, light-moderate, and vigorous bouts in 11 freely moving dogs in a foster caretaker environment over 10-15 days. The second aim was to determine the effects of proximity (absence and presence of caretaker) and distance (caretaker and dog within 0-2 m) on the dogs' physiological responses. Aim 1 results: Pulse and respiration were higher during light-moderate bouts compared to sedentary bouts, and higher at rest while the dogs were standing and sitting vs. lying. Heart rate variability (HRV) was not different between activity levels or position. Aim 2 results: During sedentary bouts, pulse and respiration were higher, and HRV lower, when there was a proximity signal (caretaker present) compared to no proximity signal (caretaker absent). Using multiple regression models, we found that activity, position, distance, and signal presence were predictors of physiological response in individual dogs during sedentary bouts. Our results suggest that combining data collected from Actigraph GT9X and PetPace monitors will provide useful information, both collectively and individually, on dogs' physiological responses during activity, in various positions, and in proximity to their human caretaker.","Ortmeyer, Heidi K.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Archerfish are well known for using jets of water to dislodge distant aerial prey from twigs or leaves. This Review gives a brief overview of a number of skills that the fish need to secure prey with their shooting technique. Archerfish are opportunistic hunters and, even in the wild, shoot at artificial objects to determine whether these are rewarding. They can detect non-moving targets and use efficient search strategies with characteristics of human visual search. Their learning of how to engage targets can be remarkably efficient and can show impressive degrees of generalization, including learning from observation. In other cases, however, the fish seem unable to learn and it requires some understanding of the ecological and biophysical constraints to appreciate why. The act of shooting has turned out not to be of a simple all-or-none character. Rather, the fish adjust the volume of water fired according to target size and use fine adjustments in the timing of their mouth opening and closing manoeuvre to adjust the hydrodynamic stability of their jets to target distance. As soon as prey is dislodged and starts falling, the fish make rapid and yet sophisticated multi-dimensional decisions to secure their prey against many intraspecific and interspecific competitors. Although it is not known why and how archerfish evolved an ability to shoot in the first place, I suggest that the evolution of shooting has strongly pushed the co-evolution of diverse other skills that are needed to secure a catch.","Schuster, Stefan","Schuster, S",NA,NA,"[Schuster, Stefan] Univ Bayreuth, Dept Anim Physiol, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Neuroethology; Behaviour; Predator; Animal cognition; Cognitive ecology","10.1242/jeb.159723","Review","stefan.schuster@uni-bayreuth.de",NA,"Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [Schu1470/1, Schu1470/3, Schu1470/6-11]","This work was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft

"savedrecs (30).txt","To navigate in the natural environment, animals must adapt their locomotion in response to environmental stimuli. The echolocating bat relies on auditory processing of echo returns to represent its surroundings. Recent studies have shown that echo flow patterns influence bat navigation, but the acoustic basis for flight path selection remains unknown. To investigate this problem, we released bats in a flight corridor with walls constructed of adjacent individual wooden poles, which returned cascades of echoes to the flying bat. We manipulated the spacing and echo strength of the poles comprising each corridor side, and predicted that bats would adapt their flight paths to deviate toward the corridor side returning weaker echo cascades. Our results show that the bat's trajectory through the corridor was not affected by the intensity of echo cascades. Instead, bats deviated toward the corridor wall with more sparsely spaced, highly reflective poles, suggesting that pole spacing, rather than echo intensity, influenced bat flight path selection. This result motivated investigation of the neural processing of echo cascades. We measured local evoked auditory responses in the bat inferior colliculus to echo playback recordings from corridor walls constructed of sparsely and densely spaced poles. We predicted that evoked neural responses would be discretely modulated by temporally distinct echoes recorded from the sparsely spaced pole corridor wall, but not by echoes from the more densely spaced corridor wall. The data confirm this prediction and suggest that the bat's temporal resolution of echo cascades may drive its flight behavior in the corridor.","Warnecke, Michaela

"savedrecs (30).txt","Estimating species population density directly contributes to the conservation of species. As keystone species, carnivores are important to conserve; however, estimating density of wide-ranging, elusive and solitary carnivores has proven difficult. The leopard (Panthera pardus) is the last large free-roaming top carnivore in South Africa, and no formal density study had been conducted across the Eastern and Western Cape. We estimated leopard density and abundance using GPS data from 21 collared leopards and a spatially explicit capture-mark-recapture (SECR) method with camera trap survey data. Four regional sites were surveyed using 173 camera trap locations over 15,390 camera trap days, capturing 740 leopard images of which 77 individuals were identified. SECR averaged 0.95 leopards/100 km(2) and the two GPS methods averaged 1 and 1.11 leopards/100 km(2). Based on predicted available leopard habitat for the region, leopard abundance was estimated between 467 (+/- 112.8) and 553 (+/- 168.8) in the Western Cape and between 365 (+/- 93.2) and 430 (+/- 139.9) in the Eastern Cape. Discrepancies in density estimates can be complex stemming from biological behaviour, anthropogenic factors and prey density. However, our estimates appear to show relatively little variation, suggesting that SECR methods and GPS data capture the population density estimates of the species well.","Devens, Carolyn

"savedrecs (30).txt","Human encroachment on wildlife habitats is leading to increased fragmentation; hence, there is an increasing focus on improving connectivity between remaining habitat. Large, wide-ranging species such as the African elephant, (Loxodonta africana), are particularly vulnerable due to their extensive habitat requirements. Wildlife corridors have been created to facilitate movement, with little knowledge to date on whether they serve their intended function as transit routes, or whether they simply extend the available habitat for occupancy. We collected data on elephant behaviour in the Mount Kenya Elephant Corridor, with the aim of quantifying the utility of the corridor. A grid of 25 camera traps was used to survey the 478 ha corridor over 11 weeks. Cameras recorded over 43,000 photos with 694 separate events triggered by elephants. Patterns of use varied spatially and temporally, indicating that certain areas were treated as habitat extension, while others were predominantly for transit. These differences were likely due to variation in vegetation cover and levels of human disturbance. Corridor use differed amongst individuals, suggesting that use may depend on both the characteristics of the corridor itself and the social or resource needs of individual elephants.","Green, Sian

"savedrecs (30).txt","As the human footprint expands worldwide, people and wildlife are coming into greater contact, and areas of human activity may be simultaneously associated with risk and reward for animals. To avoid human threats while exploiting opportunities, animals may adjust their spatiotemporal activity, using areas of anthropogenic disturbance at night when people are less active. We combined four camera trap datasets from Mozambique's Gorongosa National Park to evaluate the effects of roads and settlement on diel activity patterns of elephants (Loxodonta africana). We found high rates of elephant activity along the boundary of the park, where elephants can access cultivated crops, and along roads, which serve as movement corridors. However, elephants restricted their activity to the night and crepuscular periods in these areas of human disturbance, seeking refuge in the interior of the park away from roads and settlements during the day. Our findings suggest that a history of killing and antagonism has instilled a fear of humans in this elephant population, with implications for research, tourism and human-elephant coexistence. Our study highlights the utility of camera traps in monitoring human-wildlife conflict and habituation and demonstrates the value of integrating disparate camera trap datasets for comparative analyses on landscape or even continental scales.","Gaynor, Kaitlyn

"savedrecs (30).txt","Real-time thermography using the live-view function of a thermal camera has considerable potential to improve surveys of nocturnal wildlife relative to traditional spotlighting, while also decreasing disturbance. However, ability to identify species accurately is paramount. We use video as a proxy for real-time thermography to test African antelope identification accuracy among 34 observers of differing experience. Overall accuracy was 41% but there were substantial species-specific differences (e.g. wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) = 81%; reedbuck (Redunca arundinum) = 12%). Observer experience was significantly positively related to accuracy (inexperienced = 30%; expert = 61%) with experienced observers being better able to use subtle movement and behavioural information to identify animals. However, the effect of experience was inconsistent between species: even experts found some species challenging (e.g. waterbuck (Kobus ellipsiprymnus) where coat patterning was invisible thermographically). Self-assessed confidence did not correlate with accuracy. Observers who were good at identifying species were also good at assessing group size. We conclude that real-time thermography is not a ""magic bullet"" and the understanding of species-specific effectiveness is vital. However, for some species and some groups of observers, accuracy can be extremely high (e.g. 100% for expert observers viewing wildebeest). Tailored training is essential for real-time thermography to be a reliable field technique.","Goodenough, Anne

"savedrecs (30).txt","Ranging behaviour and temporal patterns of individuals are known to be fundamental sources of variation in social networks. Spatiotemporal dynamics can both provide and inhibit opportunities for individuals to associate, and should therefore be considered in social analysis. This study investigated the social structure of a Lahille's bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus gephyreus) population, which shows different spatiotemporal patterns of use and gregariousness between individuals. For this, we constructed an initial social network using association indices corrected for gregariousness and then uncovered affiliations from this social network using generalized affiliation indices. The association-based social network strongly supported that this dolphin population consists of four social units highly correlated to spatiotemporal use patterns. Excluding the effects of gregariousness and spatiotemporal patterns, the affiliation-based social network suggested an additional two social units. Although the affiliation-based social units shared a large part of their core areas, space and/or time use by individuals of the different units were generally distinct. Four of the units were strongly associated with both estuarine and shallow coastal areas, while the other two units were restricted to shallow coastal waters to the south (SC) and north of the estuary (NC), respectively. Interactions between individuals of different social units also occurred, but dolphins from the NC were relatively more isolated and mainly connected to SC dolphins. From a conservation management perspective, it is recommended that information about the dolphin social units should be incorporated in modeling intrapopulation dynamics and viability, as well as for investigating patterns of gene flow among them.","Genoves, Rodrigo C.

We implanted radiotransmitters in 8 male and 6 female mink living within 3 km of the Hudson River between Hudson Falls and Northumberland Dam, New York, USA, during 2009-2011 and estimated Minimum Convex Polygon (MCP), Minimum Bounding Circle (MBC), and Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) home ranges. We also estimated an Ecological Home Range (EHR) using habitat characteristics known to be important to mink. The MBC, MCP, and 95% KDE estimation methods produced home ranges that appear to include area not actually used by mink, while the EHR method appeared to more accurately reflect space used at a finer scale. The mean 95% KDE home-range estimate was 2.3 times greater than the mean MCP estimated home range and 3.3 times greater than the mean EHR estimate. The size of individual mink EHRs ranged from 23 to 164 ha and did not differ between male and female. Our results indicate that mink home ranges can be quite variable and demonstrates the importance of selecting an estimation method based on management objectives.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Spatial and temporal heterogeneity are fundamental mechanisms structuring home ranges. Under optimality, an individual should structure their space use economically to maximize fitness. We evaluated support for three hypotheses related to range optimality in American black bears (Ursus americanus), predicting (a) range location on a landscape will correspond with high vegetation productivity, (b) increasing forest fragmentation will result in larger ranges, and (c) increasing proportion of forest and/or mean vegetation productivity will result in smaller ranges. We used black bear radio telemetry data from Michigan (2009-2015), Missouri (2010-2016), and Mississippi (2008-2017), USA. Annual space use excluded winter, and we separated seasonal space use into spring, summer, and fall. We collected data from 143 bears (80 females, 63 males), resulting in 97 annual and 538 seasonal ranges. We used generalized linear mixed models to evaluate productivity (estimated through Normalized Difference Vegetation Index [NDVI]) selection, and range size (km(2)) variation between individuals. At the annual scale, black bears consistently selected areas with greater vegetation productivity than the surrounding landscape; yet selection weakened and was more variable seasonally. Opposite to our prediction, we found that increasing fragmentation consistently resulted in smaller ranges; non-forested land covers and forest edges might provide greater abundance or more diverse foods for bears. Ranges with a greater proportion of forest were smaller, likely reflecting an increase in food and cover which could reduce movements, yet there was no support for more productive ranges also being smaller as expected from an area minimizing strategy. Black bears displayed a scale-dependent space use strategy: at larger spatial and temporal scales, productivity acted as the strongest limiting factor and energy maximizing was the dominant strategy, while an area minimizing strategy was exhibited seasonally. We revealed consistent, scale-dependent responses by black bears to environmental conditions, demonstrating the intrinsic plasticity of this adaptable omnivore.","Gantchoff, Mariela

"savedrecs (30).txt","Great Lakes states are increasingly faced with questions regarding how plastic debris is impacting marine and coastal ecosystems. This is especially evident along the southern beaches of Lake Erie, where high population and industrial development have contributed to the plastics problem. In Ohio, the most common items found are cigarettes and other smoking related materials, including plastic cigar tips. Given the growing awareness of the issue, and the impact of plastics on beaches throughout the Great Lakes, a focus group convened to investigate strategies to help address the problem. The group was comprised of individuals with practical knowledge of plastic cigar tip use and disposal issues, including representatives of government agencies, nongovernmental organizations, community groups, and local academic institutions. This report represents the exploratory results of the focus group, complete with information regarding the what, why, and how of plastic cigar tip debris in the region, guidance on the material and social barriers to sustaining desired behaviors (cessation of use by minors and/or proper disposal), strategies to overcome those barriers, and suggestions for management and policy actions moving forward. Group members suggest that a combination of education and government-supported financial incentives may be the most effective approach, with community-based positive messaging backed by local taxes on smoking items that have plastic tips and rebates or other rewards for properly disposing of debris.","Hardy, Scott D.

"savedrecs (30).txt","The American marten Martes americana is a species of conservation concern in the northeastern United States due to widespread declines from over-harvesting and habitat loss. Little information exists on current marten distribution and how landscape characteristics shape patterns of occupancy across the region, which could help develop effective recovery strategies. The rarity of marten and lack of historical distribution records are also problematic for region-wide conservation planning. Expert opinion can provide a source of information for estimating species-landscape relationships and is especially useful when empirical data are sparse. We created a survey to elicit expert opinion and build a model that describes marten occupancy in the northeastern United States as a function of landscape conditions. We elicited opinions from 18 marten experts that included wildlife managers, trappers and researchers. Each expert estimated occupancy probability at 30 sites in their geographic region of expertise. We, then, fit the response data with a set of 58 models that incorporated the effects of covariates related to forest characteristics, climate, anthropogenic impacts and competition at two spatial scales (1.5 and 5 km radii), and used model selection techniques to determine the best model in the set. Three top models had strong empirical support, which we model averaged based on AIC weights. The final model included effects of five covariates at the 5-km scale: percent canopy cover (positive), percent spruce-fir land cover (positive), winter temperature (negative), elevation (positive) and road density (negative). A receiver operating characteristic curve indicated that the model performed well based on recent occurrence records. We mapped distribution across the region and used circuit theory to estimate movement corridors between isolated core populations. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of expert-opinion data at modeling occupancy for rare species and provide tools for planning marten recovery in the northeastern United States.","Aylward, C.

"savedrecs (30).txt","In many social species, acoustic dialects are used to differentiate among social groups within a local population. These acoustic dialects and their corresponding social groups are often related to distinct foraging behaviors or spatial movement patterns, and it is possible that vocal repertoire variability is one of the proximate mechanisms driving or maintaining genetic and ecological diversity at a subspecies level in social species. Short-finned pilot whales (Globicephala macrorynchus) inhabiting Hawaiian waters have a stable hierarchical social structure, with familial social units associating in larger social clusters within island-associated communities. In this study, we test the hypothesis that sympatric social groups of short-finned pilot whales have acoustically differentiated dialects, which may be used to maintain the social structure. We first examined call composition of social calls collected from photographically identified social clusters of short-finned pilot whales around the Main Hawaiian Islands, using a catalog of manually classified calls, and found that call composition differed among clusters. We then conducted ANOVA and support vector machine (SVM) learning analyses of the acoustic features of social calls. Social clusters were significantly differentiated in their acoustic features, and the SVM classification accuracy was 60%. These results indicate that vocal repertoire reflects social segregation in short-finned pilot whales and may be a driving mechanism of differentiation, potentially contributing to genetic diversity within populations. This suggests divergent acoustic population structure; however, the small sample size in this study decreases the ability to detect acoustic differences among groups. Additional sampling will improve our power to detect acoustic differences among social clusters of Hawaiian pilot whales and improve classification accuracy. The pattern described here highlights the importance of increasing the spatial and temporal resolution of conservation and management plans for this species, in order to conserve subpopulation genetic and social structure.Significance statementIn some species, vocal repertoires differ among social groups or populations of a species that use the same habitat. These differences, called dialects, are thought to be important to maintaining segregation among groups of animals with overlapping distributions, and in some cases may increase intra-specific ecological or genetic variability. This study is the first to provide evidence that sympatric social clusters of short-finned pilot whales have different vocal repertoires, and that vocal repertoire within groups may change with behavioral context. In terrestrial (e.g., elephants) and marine (e.g., killer whales, sperm whales) species with similarly stable social hierarchies, where acoustic dialects, genetic diversity, and/or ecological variability are linked with social structure, anthropogenic stressors have precipitated rapid declines in abundance with slow or nonexistent recovery. Given the myriad threats faced by short-finned pilot whales in the Hawaiian Islands, including fisheries bycatch, military and commercial anthropogenic noise, and vessel strikes, understanding intra-population social structure and its links with genetic structure and ecological variability is imperative to the proper conservation and management of this species.","Van Cise, Amy M.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Context Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are revolutionising areas of animal behaviour research and are advantageous based on their ability to be deployed remotely and unobtrusively, for long time periods in inaccessible areas.
Aims We aimed to determine the feasibility of using a WSN to track detailed movement paths of small animals, e.g. rats (Rattus spp.) 100-400g, too small for current GPS technology, by calibrating active Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags and loggers using Radio Frequency Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) as a proxy for distance. Active RFIDs are also called Wireless Identification (WID) tags.
Methods Calibration tests were conducted using a grid of loggers (n=16) spaced at 45-m intervals in clear line-of-sight conditions. WID tags (n=16) were placed between the loggers at 45-m intervals. Eight walks' were also conducted through the grid using a single WID tag. This involved attaching the tag to a small bottle of water (to simulate the body of an animal), towed around the grid using a 1-m long tow line attached to a volunteer walker. The volunteer also held a GPS device that logged their track. Models were constructed to test the effects of distance, tag movement and individual differences in loggers and tags on the reliability of movement data.
Key results Loggers were most successful at detecting tags at distances <50m. However, there was a significant difference in the detection probabilities of individual loggers and also the transmission performance of individual tags. Static tags were less likely to be detected than the mobile tag; and although RSSI was somewhat related to distance, the reliability of this parameter was highly variable.
Implications We recommend caution in the future use of current radio frequency ID tags in wireless sensor networks to track the movement of small animals, and in the use of RSSI as an indicator of individual distance values, as extensive in situ calibration is required. Off the shelf' devices may vary in performance, rendering data unreliable. We emphasise the importance of calibrating all equipment in animal tracking studies to reduce data uncertainty and error.","Krull, C. R.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Context As urban landscapes proliferate globally, the need for research into urban wildlife interactions is magnified. The eastern grey kangaroo (Macropus giganteus) is a widespread species commonly involved in wildlife-vehicle collisions in urban areas in Australia. Despite the many urban kangaroo populations and associated conflicts with human activities, few studies have examined how eastern grey kangaroos interact with, and are affected by, the urban matrix.
Aims The present study aimed to quantify kangaroo demography, movements, habitat utilisation and exposure to risks during a period of intensive urban development in a rapidly changing suburb located in a region undergoing high urban growth rates.
Methods We utilised foot-based census surveys, global positioning system (GPS) collars, direct observations and reports of wildlife mortality between 2014 and 2016. Geographical information systems (GIS) were used to integrate GPS-tracking data with spatial layers, to quantify kangaroo movements and habitat utilisation.
Key results The kangaroo population underwent a steep decline and kangaroo-vehicle collisions were the main source of mortality (73%) during the study period. Kangaroos were regularly exposed to the risk of injury, with roads intersecting many parts of their home range. Kangaroos showed positive habitat selection both for lawn and forest habitats and kangaroo movement and presence at the study site were influenced by high-quality forage and cover.
Conclusions The present research has highlighted that despite areas of suitable habitat remaining, road-kill was a major contributor to localised kangaroo-population decline. We showed that habitat preferences of eastern grey kangaroos in this urban area were consistent with those in natural landscapes.
Implications The present study is the first to implicate kangaroo-vehicle collisions as the major factor in population decline in kangaroos. These findings can be utilised to guide design and placement of kangaroo-vehicle collision mitigation and assist in planning of urban areas, particularly where kangaroo populations are in decline. Local extirpation of urban kangaroo populations would be greatly reduced by incorporating site-specific kangaroo habitat preferences and existing patterns of kangaroo habitat use in infrastructure planning. The study has contributed to our understanding of the effects of roads on urban wildlife in general and highlighted the importance of landscape permeability.","Brunton, Elizabeth A.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Context The toxic cane toad (Rhinella marina) has invaded over 50 countries and is a serious conservation issue in Australia. Because the cane toad has taken several decades to colonise northern Australia, due to the large size of the continent and the east-west invasion axis, there is scope for making testable predictions about how toads will invade new areas. The western toad invasion front is far from linear, providing clear evidence for heterogeneity in invasion speed.
Aims Several ad hoc hypotheses have been offered to explain this heterogeneity, including the evolution of traits that could facilitate dispersal, and spatial heterogeneity in climate patterns. Here an alternative hypothesis is offered, and a prediction generated for the spatiotemporal pattern of invasion into the Kimberley Region - the next frontier for the invading toads in Australia.
Methods Using observations of spatiotemporal patterns of cane toad colonisation in northern Australia over the last 15 years, a conceptual model is offered, based on the orientation of wet season river flows relative to the invasion axis, as well as toad rafting and floating behaviour during the wet season.
Key results Our model predicts that toads will invade southern areas before northern areas; an alternative model based on rainfall amounts makes the opposite prediction. The models can now be tested by monitoring the spread of invasion front over the next 5-10 years.
Conclusions Our conceptual models present a pleuralistic approach to understanding the spatiotemporal invasion dynamics of toads; such an approach and evaluation of the models could prove useful for managing other invasive species.
Implications Although control of cane toads has largely proved ineffective, knowledge of the spatiotemporal pattern of the toad invasion in the Kimberley could: (1) facilitate potential management tools for slowing the spread of toads; (2) inform stakeholders in the local planning for the invasion; (3) provide researchers with a temporal context for quantifying toad impacts on animal communities; and (4) reveal the mechanism(s) causing the heterogeneity in invasion speed.","Doody, J.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Predation is widely recognized as an important selective pressure on prey animals such as baboons (Papio spp.), which face high leopard (Panthera pardus) predation risk, particularly at night. Baboons regularly sleep on cliff faces and in trees at night, ostensibly to avoid such predators. Despite retreating to such ""refuges,"" baboons are most often killed by leopards at or near their sleeping sites. Because of the challenges of studying nocturnal behavior and human-averse predators, few systematic data exist to reveal how leopard ranging near baboon sleeping sites influences baboons' selection of sites and behavior at those sites. To investigate leopard-baboon dynamics at sleeping sites we deployed GPS/VHF radio collars on six representatives of four baboon groups and four leopards during a 14-month field study in Kenya. We used locations recorded every 15 min to identify baboons' cliffside and riverine sleeping sites, the frequency and duration of leopard visits to these sites, and baboons' adjustments in site use after leopard visits. Collared leopards visited riverine sites more frequently than cliffside sites, whereas most baboon groups strongly preferred cliffside sites, suggesting that leopard visits were often due to factors other than baboon presence, and that baboons used cliffside sites to reduce their risk of leopard predation. Regardless of type, collared leopards remained near baboon-occupied sleeping sites longer than vacant ones, indicating interest in hunting baboons then. Baboons at riverine sites departed later on mornings after leopard visits. Baboon groups occasionally shared sleeping sites simultaneously, possibly reducing risk through dilution. However, they did not reduce risk by frequently changing sleeping sites, minimizing detection at sleeping sites, or after leopard visits, arriving earlier the next evening or moving to a different site. Future research should explore if baboons readily detect nocturnal leopard presence and if predation-related changes in sleeping site use have cascading ecological effects.","Bidner, Laura R.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Diel activity rhythms in mammals are regulated by an endogenous (circadian) timing system which is synchronized by environmental 24-hr periodicities called zeitgebers. Additional direct responses to stochastic environmental factors ensure the fine-tuning to the actual situation and may mask the circadian time course. Following an observational study on behavioral effects of visitor activities in a group of spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi) kept free-ranging on a small island of Lake Catemaco, Veracruz, Mexico, we analyzed the effect of weekly varying numbers of visiting tourist boats on the monkeys' diel activity rhythm. With small accelerometer-data logger devices we recorded the monkeys' locomotor activity continuously for several months each. Then we compared the data with those from spider monkeys living without tourist contact. Neither the duration of the monkeys' activity time (alpha) nor its phase relationship to the 24-hr solar day did change on different weekdays in either site. However, their activity level showed a clear 7-day rhythm. The monkeys of the tourist site showed highest activity on Saturday and Sunday, when the frequency of visiting tourist boats was highest, whereas those of the non-tourist site were least active on Sunday and Monday, when human activities were lowest there. While the monkeys of the non-tourist site usually displayed a distinct bimodal activity pattern peaking in the morning and late afternoon, the pattern in those of the tourist site mostly lacked a morning peak and varied more over time. Based on our results, we suggest that circadian entrainment is not involved in the differences between the diel activity rhythms of the spider monkeys from the two keeping sites and the differing 7-day variation in their activity level. Rather, these differences seemingly reflect direct responses to the differing human activities and thus may correspond to circadian masking effects.","Munoz-Delgado, Jairo

"savedrecs (30).txt","Social organisms make collective decisions during group movement, thereby remaining cohesive and providing the ecological and evolutionary benefits of sociality. The ability for groups to make successful collective decisions is dependent on relationships between leaders and followers. We investigated how consistent followers (a fan structure) facilitated successful group movement in a group of Tibetan macaques, Macaca thibetana, at Mt. Huangshan in Anhui, China. We used structural equation modelling to determine the relative influences of sex, age, number of maternal familial connections within the group, dominance and social network centrality on the number of fans that an individual had and the number of other group members that an individual was a fan of (fandom). Our structural equation modelling revealed that dominant females had more fans, while younger, dominant individuals with more familial connections were fans of more individuals. Fans and fandom were most strongly influenced by dominance, displaying a strong network of females occupying top positions in the dominance hierarchy who consistently followed each other. In addition, we examined the relationship between fan structure and movement speed and success. Using regression, we found a positive relationship between fans and speed and a negative correlation between fans and number of unsuccessful movements, suggesting a link between the social connections maintained in a movement and the speed of the movement. Dominant females with more fans initiated slower movements, perhaps because the complex fan structure slowed the joining process. However, individuals with more fans led fewer unsuccessful movements, suggesting a relationship between fans and initiation success. Our findings show a network of social relationships within Tibetan macaque groups that are used during movement organization to maintain cohesion and mediate the benefits of sociality.

"savedrecs (30).txt","The human-animal relationship is a key component of human and farm-animal welfare. Farm surveys, particularly for pig, dairy cattle and veal calf production, which include regular human contact, showed that animals may face aversive handling during daily work routines, which can significantly increase their fear of humans. Similar surveys of stockperson behavior towards suckling beef cattle, which are handled less often, are rare. The aim of this preliminary study was therefore to develop a tool for assessing stockperson behavior during the occasional but common weighing procedure on commercial beef farms and then to test its potential to indicate the general human-animal relationship on such farms. Two hundred and thirty interaction sequences of stock-people handling calves on six farms were filmed during weight monitoring. During them, stockpeople's vocal and tactile interactions and locomotion were recorded in detail. Additionally, an avoidance test with an unfamiliar human was performed with the farm's heifers on pasture. Multiple correspondence analysis followed by ascendant hierarchical clustering (AHC) was performed on the sequences to identify groups of practices that stockpeople used during handling. Next, the relationship between the AHC groups according to the time spent weighing and the number of calf vocalizations was analyzed using one-way analyses of variance followed by pairwise comparisons (with Bonferroni correction). Three AHC groups of handling styles that including positive and negative features were identified: (1) mostly ""negative"" practices (67 sequences) such as hitting calves, twisting their tails or not talking to them; (2) ""neutral"" practices (62 sequences) such as talking to calves, moving quickly and pushing the calves and (3) mostly ""positive"" practices (83 sequences) such as touching the calves, not hitting or pushing them and not twisting their tails. The group using ""positive"" practices spent significantly less time weighing a calf than the two other groups (p < 0.01). In addition, the calves vocalized less with the group using ""positive"" practices than with that using ""neutral"" practices. Like for animal production systems that include daily routine handling, our study suggests relationships between stockperson practices during one-time handling events and animal reactions to humans on commercial beef farms. Observing stockpeople during less common handling events could identify poor human-animal relationships in suckling beef cattle production.","Destrez, Alexandra

"savedrecs (30).txt","We examined whether a hierarchy existed among attraction to (i) food; (ii) social partner(s); and (iii) familiar feeding location in spatial decision-making in rats. To determine this, lone food-deprived rats were trained to collect baits from 16 salient equispaced objects arranged in a grid layout. Some rats were trained with only the eight objects on the left baited; other rats with only the eight objects on the right baited. After training, dyads of one left-trained and one right-trained rats were tested, with the eight baits now divided into four on the left and four on the right sides of the arena. Rats were free either to go to the familiar objects that had been baited in the lone training trials, regardless of whether these objects were now actually baited; or, alternatively, they could go to baited objects regardless of their side and of the rats' past experience. Rats could also forage individually or together regardless of their past experience or actual bait location. We found that the rats primarily displayed attraction to baits, regardless of their location; followed by a preference to travel together; and then by a significant combined attraction to visit together baited objects (whether familiar or not). Accordingly, attraction to food had the prime influence, sociality the second, and familiarity with the environment the least, in establishing spatial foraging decisions.","Dorfman, Alex

"savedrecs (30).txt","With the rapid growth of agricultural areas globally, forest birds increasingly encounter fragmented landscapes in which forest patches are surrounded by an agricultural plantation matrix, yet how birds respond behaviourally to this fragmentation is poorly understood. Information on microhabitat requirements of birds is scarce, but nevertheless essential to predicting adaptation of bird species to the patchy landscapes. We investigated foraging patterns of three tropical insectivorous birds, Green bra Aegithina viridissima, Pin-striped Tit-Babbler Macronus gularis and Chestnut-winged Babbler Cyanoderma erythropterum, to determine whether they vary in foraging methods in different forest patches. Our study area encompassed old-logged lowland forest; one continuous forest and three forest patches. Observations were performed for 15 days every month for a period of 13 months. Information on foraging height, substrate, attack manoeuvres, and foliage density was collected independently for each foraging bird individual. All three species used different foraging substrates and attack manoeuvres in different habitat types. The Green bra frequently used lower strata when foraging in forest patches as opposed to continuous forest, while the Pin-striped Tit-Babbler tended to forage in more dense vegetation in patches. Only Chestnut-winged Babbler displayed complete foraging plasticity across all study parameters. Different habitat features (e.g., edges, microclimates) between continuous forest and forest patches significantly influenced the foraging strategies of the study species. These changes in foraging strategies suggest that some Malaysian forest birds (e.g. generalist species) can respond behaviourally to fragmentation and habitat loss. Although continuous forest has critically important characteristics that need to be conserved, remnant forest patches are also important as ecological movement corridors and foraging grounds for birds.","Mansor, Mohammad Saiful

"savedrecs (30).txt","Odontocetes modulate the rhythm of their echolocation clicks to draw information about their environment. When they approach preys to capture, they speed up their emissions to increase the sampling rate of ""distant touch"" and improve information update. This global acceleration turns into a ""terminal buzz"" also described in bats, which is a click train with drastic increase in rate, just as reaching the prey. This study documents and analyses under human care bottlenose dolphins' echolocation activity, when approaching non-alimentary targets. Four dolphins' locomotor and clicking behaviours were recorded during training sessions, when sent to immersed objects pointed by their trainers. Results illustrate that these dolphins profusely use echolocation towards immersed non-alimentary objects. They accelerate click emission when approaching the target, thus displaying a classical terminal buzz. However, their terminal buzz slackens off within a quarter of second before the end of click train. Typically, they decelerate to stop clicking just before they touch the object using their rostrum lower tip. They do not emit clicks as the contact lasts. In conclusion, when exploring inert objects, bottlenose dolphins under human accelerate clicking like other odontocetes or bats approaching preys. Bottlenose dolphins' particular slackening-off profile at the end of the buzz shows that they anticipate the moment of direct contact, and they stop just as real touch relays distant touch of the object.","Doh, Yann

"savedrecs (30).txt","Human-induced alterations of ecosystems and environmental conditions often lead to changes in the geographical range of plants and animals. While modelling exercises may contribute to understanding such dynamics at large spatial scales, they rarely offer insights into the mechanisms that prompt the process at a local scale. Savi's pipistrelle (Hypsugo savii) is a vespertilionid bat widespread throughout the Mediterranean region. The species' recent range expansion towards northeastern Europe is thought to be induced by urbanization, yet no study actually tested this hypothesis, and climate change is a potential alternative driver. In this radio telemetry study, set in the Vesuvius National Park (Campania region, Southern Italy) we provide insights into the species' thermal physiology and foraging ecology and investigate their relationships with potential large-scale responses to climate, and land use changes. Specifically, we test whether H. savii i) exploits urbanisation by selecting urban areas for roosting and foraging, and ii) tolerates heatwaves (a proxy for thermophily) through a plastic use of thermoregulation. Tolerance to heatwaves would be consistent with the observation that the species' geographic range is not shifting but expanding northwards. Tracked bats roosted mainly in buildings but avoided urban habitats while foraging, actively selecting non-intensive farmland and natural wooded areas. Hypsugo H. savii showed tolerance to heat, reaching the highest body temperature ever recorded for a free ranging bat (46.5 degrees C), and performing long periods of overheating. We conclude that H. savii is not a strictly synurbic species because it exploits urban areas mainly for roosting, and avoids them for foraging: this questions the role of synurbization as a range expansion driver. On the other hand, the species' extreme heat tolerance and plastic thermoregulatory behaviour represent winning traits to cope with heatwaves typical of climate change related weather fluctuations.","Ancillotto, Leonardo

"savedrecs (30).txt","Aggressive interactions between conspecific animals have been used as a social stressor with ethological characteristics to study how social interactions can modulate animal's behavior. Here, a new protocol based on aggressive and non-aggressive interactions was developed to study how different social interactions can alter the behavioral profile of animals re-exposed to the context in which the interaction occurred. We used factor analysis to trace the behavioral profile of socially defeated and non-defeated mice when they were re-exposed to the apparatus [three interconnected chambers: home chamber, tunnel and surface area]; we also compared the behavior presented before (habituation) and 24 h after (re-exposure) the non-aggressive or aggressive interactions. A final factor analysis from defeated animals yielded 4 factors that represented 72.09% of total variance; whereas non-defeated animal's analysis was loaded with 5 factors that represented 85.46% of total variance. A 5-min non-aggressive interaction reduced the frequency of stretched attend behavior in the tunnel, whereas a single social defeat reduced time in the tunnel and increased time spent performing self-grooming in the home chamber without conditioning any other spatio-temporal and complementary measures. Together, these results suggest that different social interactions may modulate distinct behavioral profiles in animals when re-exposed to the context.","Crestani, Ariela M.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Habitat models are fundamental tools for designing evidence-based conservation measures, particularly for locating sites with high potential for promoting a species' recolonisation and occupancy. However, it remains challenging to respond to both the need for large-scale general rules, and for fine-scale information concurrently. Multi-level habitat models provide all-in-one surfaces that explicitly account for conditional dependencies among single-level selection probabilities. We integrated occurrence data obtained from citizen-science species observation data with radio-tracking data to develop multi-level resource selection functions for the little owl (Athene noctua), a species of conservation concern in Central Europe. The results of our habitat selection analyses confirmed that suitable little owl habitat is located in widely open agricultural landscapes that often exist in the vicinity of human settlements. We mapped habitats at fine resolution (40 x 40 m) over an area covering 77,313 km(2) in Switzerland and Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany. We validated the models with external out-of sample data, and we demonstrated good predictive ability and transferability over the broad landscape. Overall, a fifth of the modelled landscape was estimated to be suitable for little owls. Habitat suitability scores in Switzerland were generally lower than in Baden-Wurttemberg due to higher elevation, fewer orchards, and more forest patches. Extant populations currently occupy c. 15% of the potential suitable habitats in Baden-Wurttemberg, and 2% in Switzerland, suggesting that considerable space for recolonisation is available. However, while Baden-Wurttemberg offers vast open landscapes, lowlands in Switzerland show narrow swaths of habitat along valleys and lakes. We showed that the simultaneous integration of different levels of habitat selection behaviour into a multi-level habitat suitability map creates a promising tool for conservation planning of endangered species over large geographical areas. Our multi-level model allowed for identification of both large-scale habitat suitability patterns to develop conservation strategies, and fine-scale clusters of high quality habitats where conservation measures can be applied at once, thereby increasing relevance of such all-in-one habitat maps for policy makers, wildlife managers and conservations practitioners alike.","Fattebert, Julien

"savedrecs (30).txt","Habitat loss and fragmentation represent major threats for the conservation of apex predators, such as the jaguar (Panthera onca). Investigating species' resource selection behavior in response to landscape alteration is critical for developing relevant conservation management plans. The jaguar is found across a variety of habitats with different gradients of human disturbance, making them a good candidate to study how apex predators respond to increasing intensity of human land use. We developed resource selection models to characterize patterns of jaguar resource selection at two different spatial scales, home range (coarse) and foraging scale (fine). This analysis was based on the largest existing GPS-location dataset for jaguars (n = 40 individuals, n = 87,376 locations), spanning the species' geographic range in Brazil and Argentina. We found that both males and females jaguars exhibited an overall preference for forests and areas close to watercourses at both the home range and foraging scale. At the foraging scale, areas of high livestock density ""attracted"" male jaguars. We also performed a follow-up analysis to test for context-dependent resource selection (i.e., functional responses) by relating individual behavior to local habitat characteristics. We found that jaguars in heavily-forested landscapes showed strong avoidance of non-forest. Furthermore, we found that only the individuals in closest proximity to watercourses showed positive selection for water. Our results highlight that jaguars display different patterns of resource selection in different areas, demonstrating a considerable ability to use or tolerate a wide variety of different conditions across the species geographic range. This plasticity may allow jaguars to adjust their behavior according to land use changes but also increases human-jaguar conflict and jaguar mortality, especially in areas with high livestock density.","Morato, R.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Elephant crop-damage is a consequence of interactions between people and elephants that impact people's livelihoods and biodiversity conservation efforts. Conflicts between people and elephants usually occur when there is overlap in elephant and human space-use leading to competition for resources. Therefore, understanding space-use patterns by elephants is key to alleviating negative human-elephant interactions. In the eastern Okavango Panhandle (Botswana), > 16,000 people share resources with 18,000 elephants. Using data from 20 GPS-collared elephants, we investigated elephant space-use in relation to landscape variables during the day and night throughout the year and during the dry, wet and crop-damage seasons. We compared elephant space-use and crop-damage occurrence during the crop-damage seasons of 2014-2016. We found that elephant space-use was determined primarily by distance to waterholes and areas away from agricultural fields. However, predicting elephant space-use at the large scale was challenging. In particular, during the crop-damage season when the relationship between crop-damage events and elephant distribution was found to be non-linear. This revealed that areas that elephants frequently use might not be good indicators of the likelihood of crop-damage. Based on our findings, we suggest deterring elephants from peoples' crops at the local scale is the most appropriate strategy for reducing elephant impacts on crops, alongside landscape scale interventions. We encourage future studies to use combinations of spatiotemporal methods, as well as practitioners to focus their efforts at the local scale, protecting elephant corridors, and supporting farmers to collaboratively work to decrease elephant crop-loss.","Pozo, Rocio A.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Partial barriers to migration can affect migratory fish population dynamics and be influenced by many biotic, abiotic, and anthropogenic factors, including nutritional deficiencies. We investigated how such variables (including a thiamine deficiency) impact fine-scale movement of landlocked Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) by treating returning spawners with thiamine and observing their attempts to climb a human-altered, high velocity stretch of river using fine-scale radio telemetry. Multiple re-entries into a river section, along with water temperature, strongly influenced movement rates. High or increasing discharge encouraged downstream movement; males abandoned migratory attempts at a higher rate than females. Although thiamine-injected salmon exhibited greater migratory duration, this did not produce a measurable improvement in passage performance, possibly due to the difficulty associated with this section of river - among 24 tagged salmon staging 10.9 attempts each and lasting 1.5 days per attempt on average, only three traversed the entire reach. This study provides new insights into how biotic and abiotic variables affect fish movement, while suggesting limits to the potential for human intervention (thiamine injections) to assist passage through partial migratory barriers.","Harbicht, Andrew B.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Sea ice reduction in the Arctic is allowing for increased vessel traffic and activity. Vessel noise is a known anthropogenic disturbance, but its effects on Arctic fish are largely unknown. Using acoustic telemetry - Vemco positioning system - we quantified the home ranges and fine-scale movement types (MT) of shorthorn sculpin (Myoxocephalus scorpius), a common benthic Arctic fish, in response to vessels and environmental drivers during open water over 3 years (2012-2014). Low overlap of core home ranges (50%) for all years and a change of overall MT proportions (significant in 2012 only) were observed when vessels were present compared with absent. However, changes in MTs associated with vessel presence were not consistent between years. Photoperiod was the only environmental driver that influenced (R-2 = 0.32) MTs of sculpin. This is the first study of vessel impacts on Arctic fish using acoustic telemetry and demonstrates that individuals alter their behavior and home ranges when vessels are present. Given increasing vessel traffic in the Arctic, additional study on the impact of vessels on these ecosystems is warranted.","Ivanova, Silviya, V

"savedrecs (30).txt","Movement is often used to indicate host vigour, as it has various ecological and evolutionary implications, and has been shown to be affected by parasites. Weinvestigate the relationship between tick load and movement in the Australian Sleepy Lizard (Tiliqua rugosa (Gray, 1825)) using high resolution GPS tracking. This allowed us to track individuals across the entire activity season. We hypothesized that tick load negatively affects host movement (mean distance moved per day). We used a multivariate statistical model informed by the ecology and biology of the host and parasite, their host-parasite relationship, and known host movement patterns. This allowed us to quantify the effects of ticks on lizard movement above and beyond effects of other factors such as time in the activity season, lizard body condition, and stress. We did not find any support for our hypothesis. Instead, our results provide evidence that lizard movement is strongly driven by internal state (sex and body condition independent of tick load) and by external factors (environmental conditions). We suggest that the Sleepy Lizard has largely adapted to natural levels of tick infection in this system. Our results conform to host-parasite arms race theory, which predicts varying impacts of parasites on hosts in natural systems.","Taggart, Patrick L.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Migratory species face well-documented global declines, but the causes of these declines remain unclear. One obstacle to better understanding these declines is uncertainty surrounding how migratory behavior is maintained. Most migratory populations are partially migratory, displaying both migrant and resident behaviors. Theory only provides two possible explanations for this coexistence of migration and residency: either these behaviors are fixed at the individual level or both behaviors are part of a single conditional strategy in which an individual's migratory status (adoption of migrant or resident behavior) is plastic. Here we test for plasticity in migratory status and tactics (timing, distance, and duration of migration) in a federally endangered mountain caprid, the Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis sierrae Grinnell, 1912). We used nonlinear modeling to quantitatively describe migratory behavior, analyzing 262 animal-years of GPS location data collected between 2005 and 2016 from 161 females across 14 subpopulations. Migratory tactics and prevalence varied by subpopulation. On average, individuals from partially migratory subpopulations switched migratory status every 4 years. Our results support the hypothesis that partial migration is maintained through a single conditional strategy. Understanding plasticity in migratory behavior will improve monitoring efforts and provide a rigorous basis for evaluating threats, particularly those associated with changing climate.","Spitz, D. B.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Aim To assess the efficacy of marine reserves in Australia for shy albatross, using long-term tracking data. Location Methods Albatross Island, Tasmania, and south Australian waters. We integrated a tracking dataset consisting of 111 individuals collected over 23 years and generated Brownian bridge kernel density estimations to identify important habitat. We quantified the overlap between the foraging distribution of early incubating adults and post-fledgling juveniles with management boundaries and marine reserves. We compared the extent of coverage of albatross foraging areas by Marine Protection Areas (MPAs) relative to a randomly designed network of the same size to determine whether the spatial protection measures are likely to be effective. Results Main conclusions Incubating adults consistently foraged in waters to the northwest of Tasmania while post-fledglings occupied shelf waters around Tasmania and South Australia. We show that our sample of 99 incubating adults adequately represented the population but that our sample of 12 post-fledgling birds was insufficient, thereby limiting the confidence in our results for this life stage. The Commonwealth Government has the majority of management responsibility for shy albatross at-sea, containing 88% and 90% of the area occupied most intensively by adult and post-fledgling shy albatross, respectively. Randomly designed reserve networks outperformed the current MPA network for both life stages, such that the mean protection by a random reserve system was 30% and 12% higher than the actual protection for adults and juveniles in Commonwealth waters. Important foraging habitat of shy albatross from Albatross Island is mostly within Commonwealth-managed waters. The current MPA network, the only spatial protection measure for shy albatross, provides less coverage for this species than a randomly placed network. An increase in the representation of productive shelf waters in MPA networks would benefit the conservation of shy albatross through reducing fisheries interactions and protecting habitat in these regions.","Mason, Claire

"savedrecs (30).txt","Aim Species distribution models (SDMs) are statistical tools aiming at mapping and predicting species distributions across landscapes. Data acquisition being limited in space and time, SDM are commonly used to predict species distribution in unsampled areas or years, with the expectation that modelled habitat-species relationships will hold across spatial or temporal contexts (i.e., model transferability). This key aspect of habitat modelling has major implications for spatial management, yet it has received limited attention, especially in the dynamic marine realm. Our aims were to test geographical and temporal habitat model transferability and to make recommendations for future population-scale habitat modelling. Location Methods Two contrasted regions of the North Western Mediterranean Sea: the cold and productive waters of the Gulf of Lion, and the warm and oligotrophic waters of Corsica. We GPS-tracked 189 Scopoli's shearwaters, Calonectris diomedea, at four breeding sites during the chick-rearing period in 2011 and 2012 (418 foraging trips), and analysed their fine-scale foraging behaviour. We then built colony-specific habitat models (GAMMs) to test SDM geographical and temporal transferability and investigated the effect of extrinsic (environmental extrapolation) and intrinsic (trip characteristics) factors on transferability. Results Main conclusions Scopoli's shearwaters from our four study sites had comparable foraging strategies (as assessed from trip characteristics and isotopic diet tracers). Despite such similarities, SDMs revealed colony-specific habitat associations. Geographical and temporal model transferability was better within than between regions. Crucially, our study illustrates how habitat-species relationships can vary between colonies located <200 km apart, and underlines the effect of spatio-temporal extrapolation in habitat modelling. We therefore warn that defining adequate spatial scales for model predictions is critical to sound marine spatial planning and conservation.","Peron, Clara

"savedrecs (30).txt","Interactions with males often alter the short-term behaviors of reproductive females. Yet, the influence of different internal and external factors, such as sexual conflict, on animal movement and patch dynamics is not well understood. We studied associations between courtship, movements of reproductive females, and genetic diversity in a small, fragmented network of Euphydras editha taylori (Taylor's checkerspot butterfly). In the absence of courtship, female movements (step lengths) were restricted (< 2 m) and tortuous, and females never departed reproductive habitat. However, when courted by males, step lengths increased markedly and movements were straighter (less tortuous). Female habitat departures were associated with interactions between patch identity and courtship. All tracked females remained in reproductive habitat in the smallest patch, whereas 32% of females departed the larger patch (over forest) while eluding courting males. Genotyping (simple sequence repeats - SSRs) suggested low levels of genetic differentiation (F-st similar to 0.02; Analysis of molecular variance p = 0.02) with inter-patch distances of <= 0.3 km. Tests for a recent genetic bottleneck were negative, but heterozygous deficient deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium expectations may indicate a developing bottleneck. Patch-specific female movement behaviors and the distribution of SSR alleles across the network suggest the possibility of a predominantly unidirectional transfer of reproducing females from the largest to smaller patches, with the smaller patches mostly closed to emigration. Our study suggests short-lived intraspecific interactions may influence dispersal in unanticipated ways and that understanding these interactions will provide a more holistic view of habitat fragmentation and network functioning.","Severns, Paul M.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Disruption of movement patterns due to alterations in habitat connectivity is a pervasive effect of humans on animal populations. In many terrestrial and aquatic systems, there is increasing tension between the need to simultaneously allow passage of some species while blocking the passage of other species. We explore the ecological basis for selective fragmentation of riverine systems where the need to restrict movements of invasive species conflicts with the need to allow passage of species of commercial, recreational, or conservation concern. We develop a trait-based framework for selective fish passage based on understanding the types of movements displayed by fishes and the role of ecological filters in determining the spatial distributions of fishes. We then synthesize information on trait-based mechanisms involved with these filters to create a multidimensional niche space based on attributes such as physical capabilities, body morphology, sensory capabilities, behavior, and movement phenology. Following this, we review how these mechanisms have been applied to achieve selective fish passage across anthropogenic barriers. To date, trap-and-sort or capture-translocation efforts provide the best options for movement filters that are completely species selective, but these methods are hampered by the continual, high cost of manual sorting. Other less effective methods of selective passage risk collateral damage in the form of lower or higher than desired levels of passage. Fruitful areas for future work include using combinations of ecological and behavioral traits to passively segregate species; using taxon-specific chemical or auditory cues to direct unwanted species away from passageways and into physical or ecological traps while attracting desirable species to passageways; and developing automated sorting mechanisms based on fish recognition systems. The trait-based approach proposed for fish could serve as a template for selective fragmentation in other ecological systems.","Rahel, Frank J.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Studies addressing the impact of salmon lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis KrOyer) on sea trout in their natural habitat are scarce and mostly limited to prophylaxis-based experiments. The main drawbacks with this approach are that lice infestations on control fish are not known and the anti-parasitic treatment is of unknown efficacy and may have unwanted side-effects. We tested an innovative approach where prophylaxis is replaced with artificial infestation of the fish. Twenty-nine sea trout post-smolts were caught in a farming-free area in southern Norway and half the fish were artificially infested with lice. Survival and behavior of individual fish was investigated using acoustic telemetry. Furthermore, salinity values were extracted from an hydrodynamical model simulation and connected to individual 3D positions. Results from this pilot study show consistent trends in behavioral differences between artificially infested and control fish. All fish that died or prematurely returned to freshwater were artificially infested fish, although results were not statistically significant. Besides, power analysis confirmed the limitations of this small pilot study for delivering statistically significant inferences. We found also indications of artificially infested fish remaining in shallower waters and within shorter distance to low salinity habitats, but only differences in modelled salinity values were statistically significant. Methodological progress and limitations with this original approach are discussed, and we recommend further studies using this combination of methods and the lessons learnt from this pilot study to provide better quantitative evidence on the effect of salmon lice on sea trout in the wild.","Serra-Llinares, R.

Here we used passive acoustic accelerometry to examine trends in the activity and swimming depth of eight juvenile sand tigers (Carcharias taurus) in Plymouth, Kingston, Duxbury (PKD) Bay, Massachusetts, USA, a recently identified nursery area. We applied a novel geostatistical modeling approach that accounts for both latent spatial and individual variation to assess the effects of time of day, tidal stage, water temperature, and lunar phase on activity patterns at both a population- and individual-level. The best-fitting model indicated that juvenile sand tigers were more active and more likely to be detected at the surface at night and during the new moon; water temperature was also a predictor of surface activity. Collectively, our results confirm conventional wisdom that sand tigers are slow-moving fish that are more active at night and provide evidence that high activity in PKD Bay may be indicative of foraging activity.","Kneebone, Jeff

"savedrecs (30).txt","We evaluated short-term movements of three radio-collared binturongs in relation to food distribution in Bornean rainforests, in addition to the basic ecological information on their home-range size and diet. Mean 95% fixed kernel and 95% MCP home-range size were 4.24 +/- 0.79km(2) and 1.54 +/- 0.89km(2), respectively (mean +/- SD). We recorded 13 fig Ficus species and four non-fig species as their foods. Fig trees accounted for 87.5% of the feeding sites of the three collared binturongs, and 87.9% including uncollared individuals. Our results suggested that binturongs' short-term movements were strongly affected by food distribution, especially figs. They feed on various fig species and may remember the location and fruiting periods of fig trees. They may use the biggest fig species, F. punctata, as a fallback food when other foods are scarce. Although this is the first systematic study to describe movement and feeding habits of binturongs, further studies are needed to understand their ecology so that proper measures can be designed for their conservation.","Nakabayashi, Miyabi

"savedrecs (30).txt","Diversionary feeding (i.e. supplementary feeding used to mitigate damage to human activities) is a management tool widely employed to avoid human-wildlife conflicts, which could alter the spatial behaviour of target species and can also affect other species present in the area, among other effects. We evaluated the effect of diversionary feeding in the spatial behaviour of the aoudad (Ammotragus lervia), an exotic ungulate associated with crop damage in the area, and we assessed the use of diversionary feeding stations (DFS) by non-target species. Nine aoudads were tracked with GPS/GSM collars. We compared their core home ranges and number of GPS locations in the DFS before and meanwhile food was available on them. Eight DFS were monitored with cameras to identify which species used the feeding sites. The home ranges changed for some individuals, but this variation was not related to supplementary feeding. Just five out of the nine tracked aoudads used DFS, and the number of GPS locations in the DFS by aoudad increased when food was available. DFS were used by fifteen non-target species of birds and mammals, and especially by the wild boar. Aoudads and wild boars segregated temporally but not spatially in their use of the DFS. Our study suggests that diversionary feeding had a limited effect on the spatial behaviour of the aoudad, suggesting that its effectiveness to reduce crop damage may be restricted.","Pascual-Rico, Roberto

"savedrecs (30).txt","Dispersal is a fundamental process that facilitates population and range expansion by providing a mechanism for colonization and metapopulation linkages. Yet quantifying the dispersal process, particularly long-distance dispersal events, has been inherently difficult due to technological and observational limitations. Additionally, dispersal distance calculated as the straight-line distance between initiation and settlement fails to account for the actual movement path of the animal during dispersal. Here, we highlight six long-distance dispersal events, representing some of the longest dispersal distances recorded for red foxes. Cumulative dispersal movements ranged from 132 to 1036 km and occurred within both sexes (1 female, 5 males). With one exception, dispersal events ranged from 7 to 22 days and tended to be directed north-northwest. Importantly, cumulative movements were up to five times longer than straight-line distances, with two foxes traveling an additional 114 and 256 km before returning to, and settling in, areas previously encountered during dispersal. This suggests a role of habitat assessment and homing behavior during dispersal and indicates that the capacity and potential for dispersal are not limiting factors to either sex in a red fox population. Dispersal capacity should thus be considered regarding transboundary management and disease control of red fox populations.","Walton, Zea

"savedrecs (30).txt","Reproduction is intimately linked with dispersal, but the effects of changes in reproductive strategies on dispersal have received little attention. Such changes have occurred in many taxonomic groups, resulting in profound alterations in life-history. In amphibians, many species shifted from oviparous/larviparous aquatic reproduction (deposition of eggs or pre-metamorphic larvae in water) to pueriparous terrestrial reproduction (parturition of terrestrial juveniles). The latter provides greater independence from water by skipping the aquatic larval stage; however, the eco-evolutionary implications of this evolutionary step have been underexplored, largely because reproductive modes rarely vary at the intraspecific level, preventing meaningful comparisons. We studied the effects of a transition to pueriparity on dispersal and fine-scale genetic structure in the fire salamander (Salamandra salamandra), a species exhibiting two co-occurring reproductive modes: larviparity and pueriparity. We performed genetic analyses (parentage and genetic spatial autocorrelation) using 11 microsatellite loci to compare dispersal and fine-scale genetic structure in three larviparous and three pueriparous populations (354 individuals in total). We did not find significant differences between reproductive modes, but in some larviparous populations movement patterns may be influenced by site-specific features (type of water bodies), possibly due to passive water-borne dispersal of larvae along streams. Additionally, females (especially larviparous ones) appeared to be more philopatric, while males showed greater variation in dispersal distances. This study also points to future avenues of research to better understand the eco-evolutionary implications of changes in reproductive modes in amphibians.","Lourenco, Andre

"savedrecs (30).txt","The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of modifications in field size, number of players, and goal size on the goalkeeper's actions in competition in male youth soccer (n = 4) (under-12). A quasi-experimental design was implemented to measure the effects of the changes in the number of players per team (8-a-side vs. 5-a-side), goal size (6 x 2 m vs. 3 x 2 m), and field size (58 x 38 m vs. 38 x 20 m) on the offensive and defensive technical and tactical actions of the goalkeeper. Four male under-12 goalkeepers (age = 11.33 +/- 0.6 years, average weekly training = 2.45 +/- 0.3 h, and years of experience = 4.8 +/- 0.9 years) were analyzed in three tournaments (8-a-side; 5-a-side; 8-a-side). The dependent variables were: defensive and offensive technical actions taken by the goalkeepers and the way their actions were carried out. The results show that in the 5-a-side soccer matches, goalkeepers carried out more defensive actions (8-a-side: 31.2 +/- 3.8; 5-a-side: 77.75 +/- 5.0; 8-a-side: 39.5 +/- 6.0; F-2,F-6 = 111,218, p = .000, eta(2) = .974; ES .998) and offensive actions (8-a-side: 58.0 +/- 7.1; 5-a-side: 84.0 +/- 13.5; 8-a-side: 58.1 +/- 9.2; F-2,F-6 = 16,257, p = .004, eta(2) = .844; ES .996) than in 8-a-side soccer matches. The reduction in field size, number of players, and goal size resulted in under-12 goalkeepers having more interaction and more variability in their actions. This information could help the different stakeholders to adapt or design the youth soccer competition rules in a way that allows goalkeepers to have more experiences.","Ortega-Toro, Enrique

"savedrecs (30).txt","Background: Small-Sided and Conditioned Games are characterised by modifications of field dimensions, number of players, rules of the game, manipulations used to shape the key task constraints that performers need to satisfy in practice. Evidence has already demonstrated the importance of designing practice to enhance understanding of tactical behaviours in football, but there is a lack of information about how coaches can manipulate task constraints to support tactical learning. Objective: To investigate which task constraints have been most often manipulated in studies of SSCGs; and what impact each manipulation had on emerging tactical behaviours, technical-tactical actions, and positional relationships between players. Methods: PubMed, Web of Science, Scielo, and Academic Google databases were searched for relevant reports without time limits. The criteria adopted for inclusion were: a) studies performed with football players; b) studies that included SSCGs as an evaluation method; c) studies that investigated tactical behaviours in SSCGs; and d), articles in English and Portuguese. Results: The electronic database search included 24 articles in the review. Of these, five manipulated field dimensions, six manipulated number of players involved, five manipulated field dimensions and number of players, five used different scoring targets, two altered the number of players and scoring target, and one manipulated the number of players, field dimension, and scoring target. Conclusion: Among the task constraints analyzed in this systematic review, manipulation of number of players and playing field dimensions concomitantly occurred most frequently.","Ometto, Lucas

"savedrecs (30).txt","Accelerometers are a valuable tool for studying animal behaviour and physiology where direct observation is unfeasible. However, giving biological meaning to multivariate acceleration data is challenging. Here, we describe a method that reliably classifies a large number of behaviours using tri-axial accelerometer data collected at the low sampling frequency of 1 Hz, using the dingo (Canis dingo) as an example. We used out-of-sample validation to compare the predictive performance of four commonly used classification models (random forest, k-nearest neighbour, support vector machine, and naive Bayes). We tested the importance of predictor variable selection and moving window size for the classification of each behaviour and overall model performance. Random forests produced the highest out-of-sample classification accuracy, with our best-performing model predicting 14 behaviours with a mean accuracy of 87%. We also investigated the relationship between overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA) and the activity level of each behaviour, given the increasing use of ODBA in ecophysiology as a proxy for energy expenditure. ODBA values for our four 'high activity' behaviours were significantly greater than all other behaviours, with an overall positive trend between ODBA and intensity of movement. We show that a random forest model of relatively low complexity can mitigate some major challenges associated with establishing meaningful ecological conclusions from acceleration data. Our approach has broad applicability to free-ranging terrestrial quadrupeds of comparable size. Our use of a low sampling frequency shows potential for deploying accelerometers over extended time periods, enabling the capture of invaluable behavioural and physiological data across different ontogenies.","Tatler, Jack

"savedrecs (30).txt","Dislodgment, in particular by breaking waves, is a widely acknowledged source of stress, if not mortality, in rocky shores intertidal gastropods. This raises the question of understanding if snails dislodged from a specific habitat have the ability to navigate back to their original substrate, and how this is achieved. In this context, we investigated the consequences of dislodgement on a population of Littorina littorea inhabiting two proximate habitats (a seawall ranging from the low to the high intertidal zone and the related low intertidal rocky platform) located on an isolated offshore reef over a three-month period. Using tagged undisturbed, disturbed, translocated and transplanted L. littorea, we assessed a potential tidal height preference and found that L. littorea showed a clear tendency to remain on their original tidal height, with recapture rates ranging between 100% and 88%, respectively 1 and 78 days after dislodgment. We subsequently measured the recapture rates of individuals dislodged from three distinct tidal levels on the seawall and from a horizontal platform. Dislodged L. littorea showed a clear tendency to return to their original tidal level, with return rates ranging between 32 and 48% 78 days after dislodgement; snails from the horizontal platform were never found on the proximate seawall. In addition, high frequency observations conducted on individually tagged dislodged L. littorea during the first 8 successive low tides of our survey indicate that individuals originating from the seawall consistently showed higher movement rates and directionality towards the seawall, while individuals originating from the platform showed no directionality and reduced migration rate. These results show that dislodged L. littorea navigate back to their original substrate and tidal height. Putative processes include a combination of geotaxis, chemotaxis and rheotaxis. At relatively short time scales (i.e. days to months), L. littorea show both tidal and habitat partitioning that is distinct from the movement patterns previously reported in littorinids over a range of temporal scales.","Seuront, Laurent

Existing models do not incorporate individual-level movement behavior near habitat edges. These small-scale details have recently been shown to be crucially important for large-scale predictions of population spread and persistence in patchy landscapes. In this work, we extend previous moving-habitat models by including individual movement behavior. Our analysis shows that populations might be able to persist under faster climate change than previous models predicted. We also find that movement behavior at the trailing edge of the climatic niche is much more important for population persistence than at the leading edge.","MacDonald, Jane S.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Locomotor diversity has meant many different things depending on the subject area or investigator. While no concrete definition of locomotor diversity is currently available, this has not stopped researchers from making a number of assertions about the underlying mechanisms that determine whether a species will have high or low locomotor diversity. Some of these claims include that: (1) arboreal primates demonstrate higher locomotor diversity than terrestrial species; (2) anatomically generalized and small-bodied primates demonstrate higher locomotor diversity than anatomically specialized and large-bodied taxa; and (3) primates demonstrate higher locomotor diversity compared to non-primate mammals. None of these claims have been tested in any sort of comparative framework. Using previously published locomotor repertoire data from 110 mammalian species, this study co-opted the Shannon-Wiener diversity index to calculate a singular measure of locomotor diversity. Phylogenetic analyses of these locomotor diversity indices reveal that within primates, small-bodied species demonstrate greater locomotor diversity than large-bodied taxa. However, this effect becomes non-significant when accounting for differences in substrate-use (i.e. arboreal vs. terrestrial). Anatomical specialization has no effect on locomotor diversity in primates. Furthermore, primates do not inherently have greater locomotor diversity than other mammalian taxa. Findings from this study suggest that movement on arboreal substrates requires all mammals, regardless of taxonomic affiliation, to demonstrate high locomotor diversity. These data further highlight the challenges faced by arboreal animals and raise the possibility that being able to switch fluidly and frequently between many different locomotor modes may be advantageous for animals moving in an arboreal milieu.","Granatosky, Michael C.","Granatosky, MC",NA,"207","[Granatosky, Michael C.] Univ Chicago, Dept Organismal Biol & Anat, 1027 E 57th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"arboreality; locomotor repertoire; positional behavior; shannon-wiener

"savedrecs (30).txt","Although the importance of Maritime Spatial Planning (MSP) as a concept is know acknowledged and the legal framework is in place, the task of applying it remains a delicate one. One of the keys to success is having pertinent data. Knowing how maritime uses unfold in a spatio-temporal context, and what conflicting or synergistic interactions exist between activities, is crucial. However, this information is especially hard to obtain in a marine environment. As a result this information has often been identified as the missing layer in information systems developed by maritime stakeholders. Since 2002, the Automatic Identification System (AIS) has been undergoing a major development. Allowing for real time geo-tracking and identification for equipped vessels, the data that issues from AIS data promises to map and describe certain marine human activities.
After recapitulating the main characteristics of MS and the data it provides, this article proposes to evaluate how MS is currently used in MSP at a European level, and to concisely present a series of methods and results obtained within the framework of several operational research projects. The objective is to illustrate how the MS data processing and analysis can produce adequate information for MSP: maritime traffic density, shipping lanes and navigation flows, hierarchical network of maritime routes, alleged fishing zones, spatio-temporal interactions between activities (potential conflicting uses or synergies). The conclusion looks in particular at the legal questions concerning the use of MS.","Le Tixerant, M.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Stopovers play a crucial role for the success of migrating animals and are key to optimal migration theory. Variation in refuelling rates, stopover duration and departure decisions among individuals has been related to several external factors. The physiological mechanisms shaping stopover ecology are, however, less well understood. Here, we explore how immune function and blood parasite infections relate to several aspects of stopover behaviour in autumn migrating short- and long-distance migrating songbirds. We blood sampled individuals of six species and used an automated radio-telemetry system in the stopover area to subsequently quantify stopover duration, bush-level' activity patterns (similar to 0.1-30m), landscape movements (similar to 30-6000m), departure direction and departure time. We show that complement activity, the acute phase protein haptoglobin and blood parasite infections were related to prolonged stopover duration. Complement activity (i.e., lysis) and total immunoglobulins were negatively correlated with bush-level activity patterns. The differences partly depended on whether birds were long-distance or short-distance migrants. Birds infected with avian malaria-like parasites showed longer landscape movements during the stopover than uninfected individuals, and birds with double blood parasite infections departed more than 2.5h later after sunset/sunrise suggesting shorter flight bouts. We conclude that variation in baseline immune function and blood parasite infection status affects stopover ecology and helps explain individual variation in stopover behaviour. These differences affect overall migration speed, and thus can have significant impact on migration success and induce carry-over effects on other annual-cycle stages. Immune function and blood parasites should, therefore, be considered as important factors when applying optimal migration theory.","Hegemann, Arne

"savedrecs (30).txt","Dispersal is one of the main processes that determine community structure. Individuals make dispersal decisions according to environmental and/or social cues that reflect the fitness prospects in a given patch. The presence and abundance of heterospecifics within the same ecological guild, and/or their breeding success, may act as public information that influences movement decisions. To date, most studies investigating the role of heterospecific attraction have focused on habitat choice, using both experimental and correlational approaches. The present study is the first to examine how long-term variation in heterospecific density in breeding patches may affect dispersal patterns in spatially structured populations. We investigate how the dispersal decisions of the great crested newt (Triturus cristatus) are related to the variable density of two other newt species, the alpine newt (Ichthyosaura alpestris) and the palmate newt (Lissotriton helveticus). To examine this issue, we used capture-recapture data collected in an experimental pond network over a 20-year period. The results revealed that the great crested newt's dispersal is context dependent and is affected by variation in heterospecific density: individuals were less likely to emigrate from ponds with high heterospecific density and were more likely to immigrate to ponds with high heterospecific density. These findings suggest that individuals adjust their dispersal decisions at least partly based on public information provided by heterospecifics. This mechanism may play a critical role in the dynamics of spatially structured populations and community functioning.","Cayuela, Hugo

"savedrecs (30).txt","This cross-sectional study aimed to assess in post-mortem the prevalence of specific claw disorders and their location on the sole in hind feet of finishing beef cattle reared indoors under intensive production systems. Evaluation was made on animals that were introduced in the ordinary slaughterhouse planning, presumably with no signs of impaired locomotion or severe lameness. A total of 4292 hind feet (right and left) belonging to 153 batches were collected (average feet/batch 28.1 +/- 5.62 (SD)) in 3 abattoirs in Northern Italy at 3 time points (April-June and September-October 2016; February March 2017). One veterinarian performed the claw trimming first and then scored the presence of specific claw disorders and their position on the sole considering 7 zones (in the digital and interdigital areas). All claw disorders in a specific zone were recorded as binary (presence/absence). Infectious (ILS), non-infectious (NILS), and global (GLS) scores were calculated considering both the type of claw disorder detected and the number of zones affected. Non-infectious disorders were the most common diagnoses among batches, mainly on the lateral claws and in the heel-sole junction area. In particular, white line abscesses and ulcers (sole and toe ulcers) were also found as two of the most debilitating and painful lesions with a non-negligible frequency. Infectious diseases, when occurring in a batch, spread to almost all feet. As expected, GLS distribution on the total feet inspected showed a non-harmful condition, given that the worst scores from 3 to 13 were assigned to a restricted sample of feet (15%) and were far from the maximum potential value of 50. However, the GLS of all batches monitored revealed 10 critical batches having no healthy feet or more than 50% of feet graded with the worst scores.
Since right and left feet of the same animal showed similar clinical diagnoses, a more efficient claw health evaluation system should consider only one foot.
Although all cattle inspected were supposed to have no evident locomotory problems before slaughter, the detection of several foot disorders and the considerable distribution in some batches might suggest poor conditions on farms affecting finishing beef cattle health, behaviour, and welfare. It is therefore advisable that possible predisposing factors of specific claw disorders on the farms of origin be investigated more deeply.","Magrin, Luisa

For three of four of our study taxa (Offadens spp., Austrosimulium spp., and Simsonia spp.), we found the numbers of drifters were consistently reduced by the weir across multiple occasions (reduction ranging from 68 to 98%) to a higher degree than natural pools (reduction ranging from 24 to 41%). Drift of Cheumatopsyche spp. through the weir was greatly reduced in December (-95%) compared with natural pools, but the weir had little effect during April (-9%). There were size-related patterns in drift through the weir pool for some taxa. In the weir pool, emigrating individuals of Austrosimulium spp. were significantly smaller than immigrating individuals, which was not observed in natural pools. In contrast, significant reductions of Cheumatopsyche spp. drifters through the weir only occurred when individuals were small (December). Within the weir pool, the combined effects of lower average water velocity, multiple large low velocity areas, and the weir wall were likely to be the cause of the reduction in stream insect drift through the weir. The impediment of drift of some taxa by weirs may affect dispersal and colonisation processes. This obstruction of downstream movement could undermine the outcomes of river restoration projects.","Brooks, Andrew J.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Increased urbanisation is leading to a rise in light pollution. Light pollution can disrupt the behaviour and physiology of animals resulting in increased mortality. However, animals may also benefit from artificial light sources, as these may aggregate prey or signal suitable environments. For example, spiders are commonly seen congregating around artificial light sources. Changes in selective pressures engendered by urban environments are driving changes in urban organisms, driving better adaptation to these environments. Here, we ask whether urban populations of the synanthropic spider Steatoda triangulosa show different responses to light compared to rural populations. Egg-sacs from urban and rural populations were collected and incubated in a common garden setting, and the emerging spiderlings tested for light preference. While rural spiderlings avoided light (37% built webs in the light), urban spiderlings were indifferent to it (49% built webs in the light). Reduced light avoidance may benefit spiders through increased prey capture, increased movement into suitable habitats, or due to a release from selection pressure from visually hunting predators which do not enter buildings.","Czaczkes, Tomer J.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Natural turf pitches are used for many outdoor sports. Turf is a complex network of interacting organic material, soil textures and water content. Turf is susceptible to damage under large surface forces, caused by intensive player movements in rugby union and football. To assess and monitor surface stability, there needs to be a reliable test method for ground staff and other stakeholders. At present, no turf stability mechanical test method exists that represents player-surface interaction, especially to represent a linear movement across the surface such as in a rugby scrummage. This paper describes the development of a novel device for assessing turf stability. Verification was undertaken in the laboratory on a variety of controlled soil samples, and during a field study. The device measurements were shown to be sensitive to the shear strength of a high clay content soil at varying water content and to the density and type of sandy soils. A programme of field data on high quality pitches suggested a large effect of the turf root reinforcement. A conceptual model of soil failure induced by the device was developed to identify the key soil variables and support experimental data interpretation.","Anderson, F. D.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Over the past decade, there has been an unprecedented boom in the application of big data derived from location-aware technology in GIScience. However, reflections on data quality lead to concerns about inaccurate or even erroneous spatial analysis results. This article contributes a meta-analysis of big data-enabled social sensing in spatial analysis. Big data-enabled research has substantially enhanced our understanding of human population distribution and dynamics, land use, travel behavior, movement patterns, and spatial social networks from city to country to global levels. However, the effectiveness of big data-enabled social sensing can be undermined by five critical issues related to research design: data volume, spatial coverage, locational information quality, and representativeness across socioeconomic and demographic groups. We suggest a framework for addressing the inherent bias in spatial big data at multiple stages of the research lifecycle and applying them to appropriate topics and scales of applications.","Liao, Chuan

"savedrecs (30).txt","Due to the advancement of tracking technology, a large quantity of movement data has been collected and analyzed in various research domains. In human mobility and physical activity (PA) research, GPS trajectories and the capabilities of geographic information systems (GIS) facilitate a better understanding of the associations between PA and various environmental factors taking individuals' daily travels into account. PA research, however, needs to widen its focus from the intensity of PA to types of PA, which may provide useful clues for understanding specific health behaviors in particular geographic contexts. This study proposes and develops an algorithm to automatically classify PA types and in-vehicle status using GPS and accelerometer data. Walking, standing, jogging, biking and sedentary/in-vehicle statuses are identified through hierarchical classification processes based on machine learning and geospatial techniques. The proposed algorithm achieved high predictive accuracy on real-world GPS and accelerometer data. It can greatly reduce participants' and researchers' burdens by automatically identifying PA types and in-vehicle status for human mobility research, which is also known as travel mode imputation in transportation research.","Lee, Kangjae

"savedrecs (30).txt","While acoustic telemetry (AT) has become the dominant technique for understanding patterns offish migration, catch rate (CR) and conventional tagging (CT) techniques still play a major role, particularly in developing countries. Understanding the potential biases of each technique is important for fish migration research. We compared these techniques for understanding the migration patterns of two coastal fishery species (Argyrosomus coronus and Lichia amia) in southern Angola. Seasonal fluctuations in the catchability of A. coronus led to incorrect conclusions about migration patterns using CR and CT and we recognised ""cryptic residency"" during the austral summer. This was attributed to a fine-scale offshore movement that was detected using AT. The AT data provided evidence for partial migration in L. amia, and while supported by the CR and CT data, these did not provide direct evidence for this intraspecific behavioural diversity. Range test results indicated that the optimal placement of nearshore AT receivers is essential, especially when migratory routes proceed along noisy, nearshore pathways. These limitations should be addressed during the design phase of fish migration experiments.","Potts, Warren Mason

This is particularly the case for species that occur in geographic regions where larval dispersal or adult migration to cooler waters is not an option. This scenario aptly describes populations of the seagrass-associated sea urchin Lytechinus variegatus inhabiting the northern Gulf of Mexico where northward movement is restricted by a coastline. In the present study, we exposed juvenile L. variegatus to chronic ambient (26 degrees C) and predicted near-future (30 degrees C) temperature treatments for 90 days. X-ray Diffraction (XRD) was employed to determine the Mg/Ca ratios of the spines, test, and Aristotle's lantern of individuals sub-sampled at 30, 60, and 90 days. We found that while individuals grew at similar rates, Mg/Ca ratios in all skeletal components were overall significantly lower in individuals held at 30 degrees C than at 26 degrees C.","Duquette, A.

"savedrecs (30).txt","The dislodging effect of breaking waves is among the critically important factors structuring rocky intertidal communities. Because behavior is so difficult to study in the field, the interaction of wave force with behavior of intertidal organisms is poorly understood. Here, we present a field study of the interaction of breaking waves with the natural behavior of individuals of Lottia gigantea, an intertidal limpet with a complex territorial behavioral ecology. We hypothesized that limpets engaging in fast-moving territorial chase in response to intraspecific contact are more vulnerable to wash-off by a passing wave than are slowly foraging limpets that do not take part in such chase. We measured the lift force required to dislodge limpets while they were engaged in three natural behavioral responses to intraspecific contact in the field: 1.) continued foraging, 2.) retreat, and 3.) territorial pursuit. We divided the measured force-to-remove by aperture area to estimate resistance to wave-induced lift force, or tenacity. Tenacity (Newtons.cm(-2 )) in slowly foraging limpets was 2-4 times stronger than previously reported for moving limpets (retreating at high speed from sea stars). Small foraging limpets showed stronger tenacity than did large limpets. Tenacity was significantly reduced by high-speed territorial and retreat responses, especially in small limpets. We compounded the wash-off probabilities of tenacity during the expected number of high-speed chases in the face of an entire year of reported waves at a nearby ocean buoy, and estimated that limpets should suffer substantially greater mortality (11.5%) than do limpets that refrain from all territorial chase (2.9%). Overall, these data support our hypothesis that dislodgement by breaking waves comprises a significant risk attendant to territorial chase. The fact that limpets nevertheless engage in these chases suggests that the resources gained by this behavior are substantial.","Mason, M. J.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Effective implementation of management interventions is often limited by uncertainty, particularly in small-scale and developing-world fisheries. An effective intervention must have a measurable benefit, and evaluation of this benefit requires an understanding of the historical and socio-ecological context in which the intervention takes place. This context or 'frame of reference' should include the baseline status of the species of interest, as well as the most likely counterfactual (a projected scenario indicating what would have occurred in the absence of the intervention), given recent trends. Although counterfactuals are difficult to estimate and so are not widely specified in practice, an informative frame of reference can be developed even in data-poor circumstances. We demonstrate this using a case study of the Bangladesh hilsa (Tenualosa ilisha) fishery. We combine qualitative and some quantitative analyses of secondary datasets to explore ecological trends in the hilsa fishery, as well as patterns of social, economic, institutional, and physical change relevant to its management over the last similar to 50 years. We compile all available information on the key parameters that determine hilsa abundance and distribution (movement, reproduction, growth, and mortality), as well as all available information on stock status. This information is used to produce a baseline and qualitative counterfactual which can be used to guide decision-making in this complex, data-poor fishery. A frame of reference provides a systematic way to break down potential drivers of change in a fishery, including their interactions, reducing the potential for unexpected management outcomes. Critical evaluation of contradictions and commonalities between a set of potential counterfactuals, as well as the reliability of sources, allows the identification of key areas of uncertainty and information needs. These can then be incorporated into fisheries management planning.","Bladon, Annabelle Jade

"savedrecs (30).txt","To assess the effect of meloxicam and lidocaine on indicators of pain associated with castration, forty-eight Angus crossbred beef calves (304 +/- 40.5 kg of BW, 7-8 months of age) were used in a 28 day experiment. The experiment consisted of a 2 x 2 factorial design where main factors included provision of analgesia and local anaesthesia. Analgesia consisted of: no-meloxicam (N; n = 24) single s.c. administration of lactated ringer's solution and meloxicam (M; n = 24) single dose of 0.5 mg/kg of s.c. meloxicam. Local anesthesia consisted of: no-lidocaine (R; n = 24) ring block administration of lactated ringer's solution or lidociane (L; n = 24) ring block administration of lidocaine. To yield the following treatments: no meloxicam + no lidocaine (N-R; n = 12), no meloxicam + lidocaine (N-L; n = 12), meloxicam + no lidocaine (M-R; n = 12) and meloxicam + lidocaine (M-L; n = 12). Salivary cortisol concentrations were lower (lidocaine x time effect; P < 0.01) in L calves than R calves 0.5 and 1 hours after castration, while concentrations were lower (meloxicam x time effect; P = 0.02) in M calves than N calves at 2, 4 and 48 hours. The serum amyloid-A concentrations were greater (lidocaine x time effect; P < 0.01) in R calves than L calves on days 1, 3, 21 and 28 after castration. Haptoglobin concentrations were greater (meloxicam x time effect; P = 0.01) in N calves than M calves 24 and 48 hours after castration. Lower (lidocaine effect; P < 0.01) visual analog scale (VAS) scores, leg movement frequencies and head movement distance were observed in L calves than R calves at the time of castration. Escape behaviour during castration was lower (lidocaine effect; P < 0.05) in L calves than R calves based on data captured with accelerometer and head gate devices. Scrotal circumference had a triple interaction (lidocaine x meloxicam x time; P = 0.03), where M-R calves had greater scrotal circumference than M-L calves 28 d after castration, but no differences were observed between both groups and N-R and N-L calves. No differences (P > 0.05) were observed for average daily gain (ADG), weights or feeding behaviour. Overall, both lidocaine and meloxicam reduced physiological and behavioural indicators of pain. Although there was only one meloxicam x lidocaine interaction, lidocaine and meloxicam reduced physiological and behavioural parameters at different time points, which could be more effective at mitigating pain than either drug on its own.","Melendez, Daniela M.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Objective
Physical activity contributes to prevent serious diseases and ailments, and previous research indicates that lifestyle habits are likely to track from early childhood to adulthood. 90% of Norwegian children aged 1-5 are enrolled in preschools, and preschool staff can play an important role in children's activity levels. This study's aim was to identify whether any associations exist between preschool staff's characteristics (initiative, participation, attitudes, and activity levels) and children's activity in preschool.
Method
289 children aged 4-6 and 72 preschool staff from 13 randomly selected preschools in a region of Nord-Troendelag, Norway, were enrolled in the study. All participants wore an Actigraph accelerometer for seven consecutive days. Questionnaires were also utilized to identify correlates between preschool staff's attitudes and initiative in relation to children's physical activity, in addition to their participation in children's physical activity. A multilevel analysis, the linear mixed model (LMM), was used to elucidate associations between preschool staff and children's activity levels.
Results
A significant association was found between preschool staff's average activity levels during preschool hours and children's corresponding activity levels during preschool hours (t = 2.57; p = 0.021; f(2) = 0.013). There were, however, no significant associations identified between the attitudes (t = -0.44; p = 0.67), initiative (t = -0.14; p = 0.89), and participation (t = 0.66; p = 0.52) variables among preschool staff and children's activity levels during preschool hours.
Conclusion
The study demonstrated that a significant association exists between preschool staff's aggregated activity levels and 4-6-year-olds' individual activity levels. However, an observational study is requisite in order to determine whether the association is based on preschool staff's impact on children's physical activity or if it is the children that affect the preschool staff's activity levels, or a combination there of.","Fossdal, Tom Stian

"savedrecs (30).txt","Background
Anthrax is a zoonotic disease primarily of herbivores, caused by Bacillus anthracis, a bacterium with diverse geographical and global distribution. Globally, livestock outbreaks have declined but in Africa significant outbreaks continue to occur with most countries still categorized as enzootic, hyper endemic or sporadic. Uganda experiences sporadic human and livestock cases. Severe large-scale outbreaks occur periodically in hippos (Hippopotamus amphibious) at Queen Elizabeth Protected Area, where in 2004/2005 and 2010 anthrax killed 437 hippos. Ecological drivers of these outbreaks and potential of hippos to maintain anthrax in the ecosystem remain unknown. This study aimed to describe spatio-temporal patterns of anthrax among hippos; examine significant trends associated with case distributions; and generate hypotheses for investigation of ecological drivers of anthrax.
Methods
Spatio-temporal patterns of 317 hippo cases in 2004/5 and 137 in 2010 were analyzed. QGIS was used to examine case distributions; Spearman's nonparametric tests to determine correlations between cases and at-risk hippo populations; permutation models of the spatial scan statistics to examine spatio-temporal clustering of cases; directional tests to determine directionality in epidemic movements; and standard epidemic curves to determine patterns of epidemic propagation.
Key findings
Results showed hippopotamus cases extensively distributed along water shorelines with strong positive correlations (p<0.01) between cases and at-risk populations. Significant (p<0.001) spatio-temporal clustering of cases occurred throughout the epidemics, pointing towards a defined source. Significant directional epidemic spread was detected along water flow gradient (206.6 degrees) in 2004/5 and against flow gradient (20.4 degrees) in 2010. Temporal distributions showed clustered pulsed epidemic waves.
Conclusion
These findings suggest mixed point-source propagated pattern of epidemic spread amongst hippos and points to likelihood of indirect spread of anthrax spores between hippos mediated by their social behaviour, forces of water flow, and persistent presence of infectious carcasses amidst schools. This information sheds light on the epidemiology of anthrax in highly social wildlife, can help drive insight into disease control, wildlife conservation, and tourism management, but highlights the need for analytical and longitudinal studies aimed at clarifying the hypotheses.","Driciru, Margaret

"savedrecs (30).txt","The spatiotemporal distribution of females is a major factor affecting animal social systems. Predation risk and the distribution of feeding resources often determine where females are found, but abiotic factors (e.g., temperature) can also shape the distribution of females and therefore variation in social organization and mating systems. Given the predicted future changes in climatic variation, it is vital to understand how animal mating systems and the sexual selection process may be altered by temperature. In bats, female distribution is tightly linked to roosting ecology and particularly to the microclimatic conditions at the roost. Proboscis bats (Rhynchonycteris naso) form cohesive and stable multi-male-multi-female groups and inhabit exposed day roosts (e.g., tree trunks, vines, buildings). Strong selection to remain inconspicuous to visually oriented predators in the exposed day roosts has been suggested to promote a rather rare male mating strategy termed site-specific dominance where males defend females directly but are successful in doing so only in their own territory. The choice of open-roost structures can result in the bats roosting under direct sunlight, making individuals susceptible to overheating. Here we investigate whether regular relocations of R. naso social groups among male territories are a mechanism of behavioral thermoregulation. Our results suggest that in general R. naso choose the warmest suitable roost sites within a roost, possibly to minimize the energetic costs of thermoregulation. However, on days with high midday temperatures at the primary roost site, bats commonly relocate to alternative, cooler sites within their roosts. These thermoregulatory relocations entail that a social group regularly switches among the territories of several males. Thus, the need for behavioral thermoregulation determines the spatial distribution of females and shapes the mating opportunities of males during the day. This is supported by our result that territorial males defending primary roost sites are reproductively more successful than territorial males of alternate roost sites. In line with other studies, our findings suggest that the increase in ambient temperatures associated with climate change has the potential to affect the intensity of sexual selection in bat species and may have far-reaching behavioral, demographic, and evolutionary consequences for their populations.","Wilde, Luke R.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Wildlife fencing has become more prevalent throughout Africa, although it has come with a price of increased habitat fragmentation and loss of habitat connectivity. In an effort to increase connectivity, managers of fenced conservancies can place strategic gaps along the fences to allow wildlife access to outside habitat, permitting exploration, dispersal and seasonal migration. Wildlife can become accustomed to certain movement pathways and can show fidelity to these routes over many years, even at the path level. Our study site has three dedicated wildlife crossings (fence-gaps) in its 142 km perimeter fence, and we continuously monitor these fence-gaps with camera-traps. We monitored one fence-gap before and after a 1.49 km fence section was completely removed and 6.8 km was reconfigured to leave only a two-strand electric fence meant to exclude elephant and giraffe, all other species being able to cross under the exclusionary fence. The removal and reconfiguration of the fence effectively rendered this fence-gap (which was left in place structurally) as a ""ghost"" fence-gap, as wildlife now had many options along the 8.29 km shared border to cross into the neighboring habitat. Although we documented some decline in the number of crossing events at the ghost-gap, surprisingly, 19 months after the total removal of the fence, we continued to document the usage of this crossing location by wildlife including by species that had not been previously detected at this location. We discuss potential drivers of this persistent and counterintuitive behavior as well as management implications.","Dupuis-Desormeaux, Marc

"savedrecs (30).txt","The recent availability of digital traces generated by cellphone calls has significantly increased the scientific understanding of human mobility. Until now, however, based on low time resolution measurements, previous works have ignored to study human mobility under various time scales due to sparse and irregular calls, particularly in the era of mobile Internet. In this paper, we introduced Mobile Flow Records, flow-level data access records of online activity of smartphone users, to explore human mobility. Mobile Flow Records collect high-resolution information of large populations. By exploiting this kind of data, we show the models and statistics of human mobility at a large-scale (3,542,235 individuals) and finer-granularity (7.5min). Next, we investigated statistical variations and biases of mobility models caused by different time scales (from 7.5min to 32h), and found that the time scale does influence the mobility model, which indicates a deep coupling of human mobility and time. We further show that mobility behaviors like transportation modes contribute to the diversity of human mobility, by exploring several novel and refined features (e.g., motion speed, duration, and trajectory distance). Particularly, we point out that 2-hour sampling adopted in previous works is insufficient to study detailed motion behaviors. Our work not only offers a macroscopic and microscopic view of spatial-temporal human mobility, but also applies previously unavailable features, both of which are beneficial to the studies on phenomena driven by human mobility.","Liu, Tongtong

"savedrecs (30).txt","To evade their predators, animals must quickly detect potential threats, gauge risk, and mount a response. Putative neural circuits responsible for these tasks have been isolated in laboratory studies. However, it is unclear whether and how these circuits combine to generate the flexible, dynamic sequences of evasion behavior exhibited by wild, freely moving animals. Here, we report that evasion behavior of wild fish on a coral reef is generated through a sequence of well-defined decision rules that convert visual sensory input into behavioral actions. Using an automated system to present visual threat stimuli to fish in situ, we show that individuals initiate escape maneuvers in response to the perceived size and expansion rate of an oncoming threat using a decision rule that matches dynamics of known loom-sensitive neural circuits. After initiating an evasion maneuver, fish adjust their trajectories using a control rule based on visual feedback to steer away from the threat and toward shelter. These decision rules accurately describe evasion behavior of fish from phylogenetically distant families, illustrating the conserved nature of escape decision-making. Our results reveal how the flexible behavioral responses required for survival can emerge from relatively simple, conserved decision-making mechanisms.","Hein, Andrew M.

"savedrecs (30).txt","BackgroundPredation is one of the most important natural selection forces. Prey species can optimize feeding behavior and escape from predators based on mobility conditioned by body proportions. With age, mobility capacity increases and individuals are more efficient in finding resources and safety (e.g., food and refuge). Birds' mobility is driven by the dimensions, of the head and torso, as well as the extremities and flight feathers. To assess the relationship between body traits and to understand how body proportions are organized in wild Red-legged partridges (Alectoris rufa), we used biometric data from nearly 14,000 individuals, obtained during a long-term study (1988-2011) on a wild population.ResultsWe used GLMs and regressions to model the relationship between body mass and the size of body parts. We found that wing length was the morphological part best explained by other body trait measures. Wing length models were better predictors in juveniles than in adults and in females than in males. Wing length and feather length, mass and total length are the most strongly related parts; mass and wing length, total length and feather length are moderately related. The association between mass and wing length is intermediated by feather length and total length.ConclusionsSocial inclusion, feeding and predator evasion may be affected by body structure intermediated by mobility and health. Our results suggest that proportions of the body, extremities and flight feathers drive mobility which is intimately associated with ecology, biological efficiency, health and physical optimization. Our findings showed that wing size was strongly allied to other body part measurements, enhancing the importance of body structure conformation for flight. Our study highlights the scaled relationship of body structure among age-sex classes and its relevance to social cohesion, flock movement and the balance between predation and starvation.","Nadal, Jesus

"savedrecs (30).txt","A highly advocated approach to enhance pest control by indigenous predators is to add or maintain appropriate non-crop plant habitats in agrosystems. Although the addition of non-crop plant habitats can enhance the number of predators in crop by increasing their food resources or shelter, the effect is often insufficient to reduce pest abundance or damage. A number of explanations were identified in previous studies; the ability of such habitats to enhance predators, in particular, is affected by the spatial organisation of the habitats at the land-scape level. Here, we explore how intra-plot spatial patterns of non-crop habitats affect the per-capita predator effect on pest control. We use a spatially explicit and individual-based model to simulate the foraging movements of an earwig-like predator in a banana field. Predator movements within a day were based on a simple non-specific behavioural assumption: movement is a correlated random walk affected by habitats and edges. Population dynamic processes occurring at larger time or spatial scales, such as reproduction and immigration, were not considered. In this model, non-crop habitats added to plots were considered favourable to predators: movements were slower and more sinuous in non-crop habitat than in unfavourable habitats. The intra-plot spatial patterns of the non-crop habitat were built and characterised using landscape ecology concepts and metrics. We found that the per-capita predator effect was strongly affected by a spatial dilution of predators, induced by non-crop habitat addition, but this negative effect could be partially or fully mitigated by the spatial organisation of the non-crop habitat. At the banana plant level, a long edge length between the crop and non-crop habitat can compensate for this dilution effect by reducing the duration of the periods between predator visits to the banana plant. At the plot level, the best plots (i.e., those in which all banana plants were often visited by predators) were those with non-crop strips in the banana plant rows. Overall, the results support the idea that the spatial organisation of non-crop habitats at the plot level, characterised by the metric edge length in particular, can be managed to minimise the negative impact of the dilution effect.","Collard, B.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Background. Weighted-baseball training programs are used at the high school, collegiate, and professional levels of baseball. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of a six-week training period consisting of weighted implements, manual therapy, weightlifting, and other modalities on shoulder external rotation, elbow valgus stress, pitching velocity, and kinematics.
Hypothesis. A six-week training program that includes weighted implements will increase pitching velocity along with concomitant increases in arm angular velocities, joint kinetics, and shoulder external rotation.
Methods. Seventeen collegiate and professional baseball pitchers (age range 18-23, average: 19.9 +/- 1.3) training at Driveline Baseball were evaluated via a combination of an eight-camera motion-capture system, range-of-motion measurements and radar- and pitch-tracking equipment, both before and after a six-week training period. Each participant received individualized training programs, with significant overlap in training methods for all athletes. Twenty-eight biomechanical parameters were computed for each bullpen trial, four arm range-of-motion measurements were taken, and pitching velocities were recorded before and after the training period. Pre- and post-training period data were compared via post-hoc paired t tests.
Results. There was no change in pitching velocity across the seventeen subjects. Four biomechanical parameters for the holistic group were significantly changed after the training period: internal rotational velocity was higher (from 4,527 +/- 470 to 4,759 +/- 542 degrees/second), shoulder abduction was lower at ball release (96 +/- 7.6 to 93 +/- 5.4 degrees), the shoulder was less externally rotated at ball release (95 +/- 15 to 86 +/- 18 degrees) and shoulder adduction torque was higher (from 103 +/- 39 to 138 +/- 53 N-m). Among the arm range of motion measurements, four were significantly different after the training period: the shoulder internal rotation range of motion and total range of motion for both the dominant and non-dominant arm. When the group was divided into those who gained pitching velocity and those who did not, neither group showed a significant increase in shoulder external rotation, or elbow valgus stress.
Conclusions. Following a six-week weighted implement program, pitchers did not show a significant change in velocity, joint kinetics, or shoulder external rotation range of motion. When comparing pitchers who gained velocity versus pitchers who did not, no statistically significant changes were seen in joint kinetics and shoulder range of motion.","Marsh, Joseph A.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Predation involves more than just predators consuming prey. Indirect effects, such as fear responses caused by predator presence, can have consequences for prey life history. Laboratory experiments have shown that some rodents can recognize fear in conspecifics via alarm pheromones. Individuals exposed to alarm pheromones can exhibit behavioural alterations that are similar to those displayed by predator-exposed individuals. Yet the ecological and evolutionary significance of alarm pheromones in wild mammals remains unclear. We investigated how alarm pheromones affect the behaviour and fitness of wild bank voles (Myodes glareolus) in outdoor enclosures. Specifically, we compared the effects of exposure of voles living in a natural environment to a second-hand fear cue, bedding material used by predator-exposed voles. Control animals were exposed to bedding used by voles with no predator experience. We found a ca. 50% increase in litter size in the group exposed to the predator cue. Furthermore, female voles were attracted to and males were repelled by trap-associated bedding that had been used by predator-exposed voles. Movement and foraging were not significantly affected by the treatment. Our results suggest that predation risk can exert population-level effects through alarm pheromones on prey individuals that did not encounter a direct predator cue.","Haapakoski, M.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Loss of dispersal typifies island biotas, but the selective processes driving this phenomenon remain contentious. This is because selection via, both indirect (e.g. relaxed selection or island syndromes) and direct (e.g. natural selection or spatial sorting) processes may be involved, and no study has yet convincingly distinguished between these alternatives. Here, we combined observational and experimental analyses of an island lizard, the Komodo dragon (Varanus komodoensis, the world's largest lizard), to provide evidence for the actions of multiple processes that could contribute to island dispersal loss. In the Komodo dragon, concordant results from telemetry, simulations, experimental translocations, mark-recapture, and gene flow studies indicated that despite impressive physical and sensory capabilities for long-distance movement, Komodo dragons exhibited near complete dispersal restriction: individuals rarely moved beyond the valleys they were born/captured in. Importantly, lizard site-fidelity was insensitive to common agents of dispersal evolution (i.e. indices of risk for inbreeding, kin and intraspecific competition, and low habitat quality) that consequently reduced survival of resident individuals. We suggest that direct selection restricts movement capacity (e.g. via benefits of spatial philopatry and increased costs of dispersal) alongside use of dispersal-compensating traits (e.g. intraspecific niche partitioning) to constrain dispersal in island species.","Jessop, Tim S.

"savedrecs (30).txt","The availability alongside growing awareness of medicine has led to increased self-treatment of minor ailments. Self-medication is where one 'self' diagnoses and prescribes over the counter medicines for treatment. The self-care movement has important policy implications, perceived to relieve the National Health Service (NHS) burden, increasing patient subsistence and freeing resources for more serious ailments. However, there has been little research exploring how self-medication behaviours vary between population groups due to a lack of available data. The aim of our study is to evaluate how high street retailer loyalty card data can help inform our understanding of how individuals self-medicate in England. Transaction level loyalty card data was acquired from a national high street retailer for England for 2012-2014. We calculated the proportion of loyalty card customers (n similar to 10 million) within Lower Super Output Areas who purchased the following medicines: 'coughs and colds', 'Hayfever', 'pain relief' and 'sun preps'. Machine learning was used to explore how 50 sociodemographic and health accessibility features were associated towards explaining purchasing of each product group. Random Forests are used as a baseline and Gradient Boosting as our final model. Our results showed that pain relief was the most common medicine purchased. There was little difference in purchasing behaviours by sex other than for sun preps. The gradient boosting models demonstrated that socioeconomic status of areas, as well as air pollution, were important predictors of each medicine. Our study adds to the self-medication literature through demonstrating the usefulness of loyalty card records for producing insights about how self-medication varies at the national level. Big data offer novel insights that add to and address issues that traditional studies are unable to consider. New forms of data through data linkage may offer opportunities to improve current public health decision making surrounding at risk population groups within self-medication behaviours.","Davies, Alec

"savedrecs (30).txt","Trajectory data uploaded by mobile devices is growing quickly. It represents the movement of an individual or a device based on the longitude and latitude coordinates collected by GPS. The location based service has a broad application prospect in the real world. As the traditional location prediction models which are based on the discrete state sequence cannot predict the locations in real time, we propose a Continuous Time Series Markov Model (CTS-MM) to solve this problem. The method takes the Gaussian Mixed Model (GMM) to simulate the posterior probability of a location in the continuous time series. The probability calculation method and state transition model of the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) are improved to get the precise location prediction. The experimental results on GeoLife data show that CTS-MM performs better for location prediction in exact minute than traditional location prediction models.","Du, Yongping

"savedrecs (30).txt","Collective behavior, such as shoaling in teleost fish, is driven by the perceptual recognition of conspecific animals. Because social interactions are mutual, it has been difficult to disentangle the exact sensory cues that trigger affiliation in the first place from those that are emitted by receptive and responsive shoal mates. Here, we overcome this challenge in a virtual reality assay in zebrafish. We discovered that simple visual features of conspecific biological motion provide a potent shoaling cue. Individual juvenile fish shoal for hours with circular black dots projected onto a screen, provided these virtual objects mimic the characteristic kinetics of zebrafish swim bouts. Other naturalistic cues previously implicated in shoaling, such as fish-like shape, pigmentation pattern, or non -visual sensory modalities are not required. During growth, the animals' stimulus preferences shift gradually, matching self-like kinetics, and this tuning exists even in fish raised in isolation. Virtual group interactions and our multi-agent model implementation of this perceptual mechanism demonstrate that kinetic cues can drive assortative shoaling, a phenomenon commonly observed in field studies. Coordinated behavior can emerge from autonomous interactions, such as collective odor avoidance in Drosophila, or from reciprocal interactions, such as the codified turn-taking in wren duet singing. We found that individual zebrafish shoal autonomously without evidence for a reciprocal choreography. Our results reveal individual-level, innate perceptual rules of engagement in mutual affiliation and provide experimental access to the neural mechanisms of social recognition.","Larsch, Johannes

"savedrecs (30).txt","Observations of animals feeding in aggregations are often interpreted as events of social foraging, but it can be difficult to determine whether the animals arrived at the foraging sites after collective search [1-4] or whether they found the sites by following a leader [5, 6] or even independently, aggregating as an artifact of food availability [7, 8]. Distinguishing between these explanations is important, because functionally, they might have very different consequences. In the first case, the animals could benefit from the presence of conspecifics, whereas in the second and third, they often suffer from increased competition [3,9-13]. Using novel miniature sensors, we recorded GPS tracks and audio of five species of bats, monitoring their movement and interactions with conspecifics, which could be inferred from the audio recordings. We examined the hypothesis that food distribution plays a key role in determining social foraging patterns [14-16] Specifically, this hypothesis predicts that searching for an ephemeral resource (whose distribution in time or space is hard to predict) is more likely to favor social foraging [10,13-15] than searching for a predictable resource. The movement and social interactions differed between bats foraging on ephemeral versus predictable resources. Ephemeral species changed foraging sites and showed large temporal variation nightly. They aggregated with conspecifics as was supported by playback experiments and computer simulations. In contrast, predictable species were never observed near conspecifics and showed high spatial fidelity to the same foraging sites over multiple nights. Our results suggest that resource (un)predictability influences the costs and benefits of social foraging.","Egert-Berg, Katya

"savedrecs (30).txt","Bearded seals are one of the least studied Arctic marine mammals, despite their circumpolar distribution and importance as a resource to Inuit communities. In this study, adult bearded seals (Erignathus barbatus) were equipped with GPS-Argos-CTD-SRDLs in Svalbard, Norway (2011-2012, n = 7) to document their diving, activity and movement patterns in a region where their habitat is changing rapidly. Five seals transmitted for > 8 months, sending 21,738 GPS-positions and 17,866 dives between July and April. The seals spent little time hauled out (<= 5%). Diving, which occupied 74 +/- 3% of their time, was generally shallow (24 +/- 7 m, max: 391 m) and of short duration (6.6 +/- 1.5 min, max: 24 min) with deeper, longer dives in winter/spring compared to summer. All seals occupied shallow, coastal areas and relatively small 50% home ranges (10-32 km(2) ). However, individuals exhibited high degrees of specialization in their habitat use and diving behaviour, differing markedly with respect to proportions of benthic vs pelagic dives (range: 51-95% benthic dives), distance to glacier fronts (range: 3-22 km) and in the time spent at the bottom of dives (range: 43-77%). Having specialized strategies within a generalist population may help bearded seals adapt in a rapidly changing Arctic ecosystem.","Hamilton, Charmain D.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Mid-latitude (similar to 30-60 degrees) seasonally stratifying shelf-seas support a high abundance and diversity of marine predators such as marine mammals and seabirds. However, anthropogenic activities and climate change impacts are driving changes in the distributions and population dynamics of these animals, with negative consequences for ecosystem functioning. Across mid-latitude shelf-seas marine mammals and seabirds are known to forage across a number of oceanographic habitats that structure the spatio-temporal distributions of prey fields. Knowledge of these and the bio-physical mechanisms driving such associations are needed to improve marine management and policy. Here, we provide a concise and easily accessible guide for both researchers and managers of marine systems on the predominant oceanographic habitats that are favoured for foraging by marine mammals and seabirds across mid-latitude shelf-seas. We (1) identify and describe key discrete physical features present across the continental shelf, working inshore from the shelf-edge to the shore line, (2) provide an overview of findings relating to associations between these habitats and marine mammals and seabirds, (3) identify areas for future research and (4) discuss the relevance of such information to conservation management. We show that oceanographic features preferentially foraged at by marine mammals and seabirds include shelf edge fronts, upwelling and tidal-mixing fronts, offshore banks and internal waves, regions of stratification, and topographically complex coastal areas subject to strong tidal flow. Whilst associations were variable across taxa and through space and time, in the majority of cases interactions between bathymetry and tidal currents appear to play a dominant role, alongside patterns in seasonal stratification and shelf-edge upwelling. We suggest that the ecological significance of these bio-physical structures stems from a capacity to alter the densities, distributions (both horizontally and vertically) and/or behaviours of prey in a persistent and/or predictable manner that increases accessibility for predators, and likely enhances foraging efficiency. Future conservation management should aim to preserve and protect these habitats. This will require adaptive and holistic strategies that are specifically tailored to the characteristics of an oceanographic feature, and where necessary, evolve through space and time in response to spatio-temporal variability. Improved monitoring of animal movements and biophysical conditions across shelf-seas would aid in this. Areas for future research include multi-disciplinary/ trophic studies of the mechanisms linking bio-physical processes, prey and marine mammals and seabirds (which may elucidate the importance of lesser studied features such as bottom fronts and Langmuir circulation cells), alongside a better understanding of how predators perceive their environment and develop foraging strategies during immature/juvenile stages. Estimates of the importance of oceanographic habitat features at a population level should also be obtained. Such information is vital to ensuring the future health of these complex ecosystems, and can be used to assess how anthropogenic activities and future environmental changes will impact the functioning and spatio-temporal dynamics of these bio-physical features and their use by marine predators.","Cox, S.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Swallows and martins (Aves: Hirundinidae) are well-studied with respect to their breeding biology, but major aspects of their individual aerial movement behavior and ecology are poorly understood. Atmospheric conditions can strongly influence both the availability and distribution of flying insects that aerial insectivores rely upon. Because aerial insects are often found in distinct clusters within the aerosphere, we wanted to explore whether aerial insectivore flight altitudes were species-specific and if they were associated with atmospheric conditions. We examined these questions with novel tag technology, an altitude datalogger, on breeding populations of Purple Martin (Progne subis), Tree Swallow (Tachycineta bicolor), and Barn Swallow (Hirundo rustica) in upstate New York during the summer of 2016, providing individual-level flight data on a per minute basis. Using mixed models, we investigated differences in flight altitudes between individuals, species, and varying atmospheric conditions. The major findings were that individuals of each species spent significantly different proportions of their time throughout the day in different aerial strata. In addition, higher flying species such as Purple Martins and Tree Swallows responded positively to greater thermal uplift whereas this predictor had no effect on Barn Swallow flight altitudes. Finally, the differing relationships for all species between their flight altitudes and weather variables suggest that each species may use different atmospheric cues for tracking their environment and/or prey. More research spanning greater time scales and a wider range of atmospheric conditions is needed to determine these relationships in finer detail. We encourage broader use of this or similar methodologies to better understand the behavior and ecology of aerial insectivores globally.","Dreelin, R. Andrew

"savedrecs (30).txt","Marine protected areas (MPAs) are considered an effective tool for protecting marine organisms. The precise estimation of home range size, as well as diel differences in home ranges, are essential when considering the appropriate size of an MPA. In addition, behavioral characteristics of spawning migration should also be considered for species that form spawning aggregations. Our aim was to clarify the diel variation in home range size and the degree of precision of the returning ability of white-streaked grouper Epinephelus onus by acoustic telemetry. Seventeen individuals were studied, and nighttime home range sizes that were calculated by 50 and 95% kernel utilization distributions were 5.9-fold and 5.5-fold greater, respectively, than the daytime home ranges. The average inter-center distance between home ranges during the 2 time periods ranged from 3.0 to 67.9 m (22.5 m on average), suggesting that the day-night home range shift within the home ground varied individually. Returning ability for 10 individuals that showed clear spawning migration behavior was also analyzed, and the average inter-center distance between home ranges during the periods before and after spawning was 8.1 m. Eight out of these 10 individuals showed precise returning after the spawning migration to the patchy coral substrates that were used before the spawning migration. The present study suggests that appropriate setting position of the home ground can establish long-term protection of the species due to their precise returning ability after the spawning migration.","Nanami, Atsushi

"savedrecs (30).txt","Most reef fish surveys use bait to attract individuals to bite hooks, enter traps, or be counted on underwater video. The behavior of fish around baited gears, however, is poorly understood despite its importance for estimating catchability. We used a fine-scale acoustic positioning system to elucidate the movement behaviors of 11 telemetered gray triggerfish Balistes capriscus around 54 baited fish traps deployed at a 37 m deep site in Raleigh Bay, North Carolina, USA. Median positional error rates from a reference transmitter were 1-2 m, suggesting fish positions were accurate and precise. Overall, 104 170 spatial positions were determined for gray triggerfish over the 42 d study. There were 27 instances of telemetered gray triggerfish responding to baited fish traps. These fish responded from initial distances up to 312 m (mean = 68 m) from traps and spent 4-95% (mean = 35%) of their time within 20 m of traps. Using generalized additive models, we determined that telemetered gray triggerfish were most likely to respond to baited traps when they were initially located close to (<100 m), and down-current from, baited traps. There were substantial differences in gray triggerfish responses and water clarity across the 3 recapture periods, suggesting gray triggerfish use vision, olfaction, and perhaps sound to locate bait. Our modeling approach is general, and could be used to quantify the behavior of myriad organisms around sampling gears in various types of aquatic systems.","Bacheler, Nathan M.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Central-place foraging in large seabird colonies leads to high levels of intra-specific competition for food resources, often resulting in between-colony spatial segregation. However, little is known about within-colony variation in foraging behaviour that may arise from breeding locations. Using little penguins Eudyptula minor from a large colony (ca. 32 000 individuals) on Phillip Island (Australia), we present a novel approach combining GPS, diving, acceleration and bathymetry data. We investigated within-colony variation in 3-dimensional distribution of prey encounters and its consequences for foraging behaviour and breeding success. Over 1 breeding season, we simultaneously tracked 63 little penguins from 2 breeding sites located similar to 2 km apart and monitored their breeding success. We recorded 58 452 dives, of which 11 992 had prey encounter events associated. Results revealed strong spatial foraging segregation between sites throughout the breeding season and differences between sites in prey encounter depth during chick-rearing (mean +/- SE, 11.8 +/- 0.2 m vs. 17.3 +/- 0.3 m). Birds from one site foraged in deeper waters and apparently experienced higher levels of competition, resulting in lower prey encounter rates and lower foraging efficiency (i.e. body mass gain after foraging trips), hence these birds seemed less successful. However, breeding success was high (>1.5 chicks fledged per pair) at both sites, indicating that food was not a limiting factor that year. Nonetheless, breeding success records over the last 12 yr showed that the site where birds foraged at deeper depths produced fewer chicks. Our findings highlight the importance of understanding small-scale spatial segregation to capture foraging behaviour variation within large seabird colonies.","Sanchez, Sonia

"savedrecs (30).txt","Large mammals that live in arid and/or desert environments can cope with seasonal and local variations in rainfall, food and climate1 by moving long distances, often without reliable water or food en route. The capacity of an animal for this long-distance travel is substantially dependent on the rate of energy utilization and thus heat production during locomotion-the cost of transport(2,3,4). The terrestrial cost of transport is much higher than for flying (7.5 times) and swimming (20 times)4. Terrestrial migrants are usually large(1,2,3) with anatomical specializations for economical locomotion(5,6,7,8,9), because the cost of transport reduces with increasing size and limb length(5,6,7). Here we used GPS-tracking collars10 with movement and environmental sensors to show that blue wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus, 220 kg) that live in a hot arid environment in Northern Botswana walked up to 80 km over five days without drinking. They predominantly travelled during the day and locomotion appeared to be unaffected by temperature and humidity, although some behavioural thermoregulation was apparent. We measured power and efficiency of work production (mechanical work and heat production) during cyclic contractions of intact muscle biopsies from the forelimb flexor carpi ulnaris of wildebeest and domestic cows (Bos taurus, 760 kg), a comparable but relatively sedentary ruminant. The energetic costs of isometric contraction (activation and force generation) in wildebeest and cows were similar to published values for smaller mammals. Wildebeest muscle was substantially more efficient (62.6%) than the same muscle from much larger cows (41.8%) and comparable measurements that were obtained from smaller mammals (mouse (34%)11 and rabbit (27%)). We used the direct energetic measurements on intact muscle fibres to model the contribution of high working efficiency of wildebeest muscle to minimizing thermoregulatory challenges during their long migrations under hot arid conditions.","Curtin, Nancy A.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Growing evidence has accumulated in recent years showing that movement behaviors have important implications for health in children, especially for cardiovascular health, whose risk factors could track from childhood to adulthood. However, these findings are mixed and inconsistent in children. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between different movement behaviors (sedentary behavior, physical activity and sleep duration) and cardiometabolic risk in schoolchildren. The study shows cross-sectional results of baseline measurement from 146 Spanish schoolchildren, aged 8-to-11 years old, participating in the MOVI-2 study. Movement behaviors were determined using accelerometry combined with self-reported sleep time. Cardiometabolic risk was assessed using a validated metabolic syndrome index. Logistic regression analysis showed that higher levels of vigorous physical activity (OR = 0.110, p = 0.004) and sleeping more than 9 hours (OR = 0.269, p = 0.015) could be protective factors against metabolic syndrome risk in children. ANCOVA analysis showed associations between vigorous physical activity and waist circumference (p < 0.001), and sleep time with insulin resistance (p = 0.017) and lipid profile (p = 0.035). No association was observed between light and moderate physical activity, sedentary behavior and metabolic syndrome (index and components). No statistically significant differences were found for blood pressure and any of the movement behaviors. Our data suggest that both the amount of vigorous physical activity accumulated and sleep duration are independently associated with higher cardiometabolic risk in children.","Lucas-de la Cruz, Lidia

"savedrecs (30).txt","Knowledge of connectivity and population structure is integral to the sustainable management of fished populations, yet such information is unavailable for many species over scales relevant to their exploitation. We examined broad-scale patterns and drivers of adult movement for a putatively mobile carangid (Pseudocaranxgeorgianus) on Australia's southeast coast using an angler tag-recapture dataset. More than 6300 individuals were tagged and released across 1007 km of coastline, with anglers recapturing 157 (2.48%) individuals during a 14-year period. Median distance moved was 5 km and a substantial proportion of individuals (19%) were recaptured at their release location. Recapture latitude was also strongly predicted by release latitude (r(2) = 0.87). However, a broad range of movements were observed (0-508 km), with 6% of individuals moving further than 100 km. Most individuals recaptured in areas now designated as Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) were originally released in the same area (79.2%). Larger body size, longer periods at liberty, and releases during Spring all positively influenced distance moved. Results support restricted movement over an intermediate scale, punctuated by occasional large movements. Our findings suggest adult movement of P. georgianus in southeastern Australia primarily occurs over smaller distances than the current spatial scale of management.","Fowler, Ashley M.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Modelling is important for impact assessments of anthropogenic pressures on wildlife. Models are particularly useful when dealing with complex dynamic systems (as pelagic ecosystems) where data are limited and if various 'what if' scenarios should be tested. The aim of this study was to produce and implement an integrated modelling approach, linking high resolution hydrodynamic models (HDM) of the marine environment with correlative species distribution models (SDM) and agent-based models (ABM), for describing the spatio-temporal distribution and movements of Atlantic mackerel (Scornber scombrus) in the Norwegian Sea. The SDM was fitted with scientific mackerel trawl data as response variables (collected in July and August 2006-2014) and temperature (from the HDM), water depth and time period as predictors of spatial distributions. The SDM was able to produce dynamic predictions of a similar order of magnitude as observed catch per unit effort (CPUE) as well as realistic large-scale distribution patterns, when tested on independent data (not included in the modelling). The ABM was calibrated, with normalized SDM predictions (habitat suitability as a proxy for food availability) and hydrodynamics as input and simulated on a single year (2013) for the period May-October, when the migratory mackerel is present in the study area. A pattern-oriented modelling (POM) approach was used to verify if the model reproduced multiple observed real-world patterns. The ABM produced similar patterns as observed regarding migration timing, growth and large scale geographic distribution. Fine scaled information on mackerel movement and behaviour is limited, which is also reflected in the results. More data and knowledge are therefore required to improve the patterns emerging from fine scaled processes. The potential of the model for assessing an impact of a single seismic survey (mimicking a real survey) was finally evaluated. The exercise allowed estimating the number of affected fish (within 50 km from the sound source) and potential changes in local migrations, with the specific assumed minimum sound pressure thresholds (resulting in a fleeing reaction by the mackerel) set to 165 dB re 1 mu Pa. The model framework was shown to be useful by allowing simulations of impact scenarios in a realistic and dynamic environment. The model can be further updated when data on fine scale movements of mackerel and most importantly when improved data on response behaviour to impacts of sound become available.","Heinanen, Stefan

"savedrecs (30).txt","Determining habitat requirements for the persistence of a wildlife population is especially difficult for wide-ranging, opportunist species. The American black bear (Ursus americanus) is one such species that is re-colonizing parts of its former range and colonizing new geographic regions. We sought to predict the potential for further westward expansion of a population of black bears that has recently colonized a primarily agricultural (> 50%) landscape with small fragmented islands of forest (similar to 17%) at the edge of its range in northwestern Minnesota. We delineated critical aspects of bears' spatial ecology by examining size and habitat composition of home ranges of GPS-collared individuals (n = 38; 75 bear-years; 2007-2013) at both annual and weekly temporal scales. We measured food production by habitat type, and used a moving window equivalent to a weekly home range (WHR) to quantify and map habitat suitability across the region, considering temporal variations in observed natural forage availability. Male bears used expansive home ranges on an annual basis (largest recorded for this species; 95% KDE h-ref: (X) over bar = 834 km(2), 95% CI = 596-1072 km(2)); females traveled less, but still had relatively large home ranges (95% KDE h-ref: (X) over bar = 91 km(2), 95% CI = 55-128 km(2)). Summer and fall WHRs contracted when they included higher percentages of oak forest or crop cover (key foods), and expanded with a higher density of roads and higher percentage of non-consumable agriculture and wetlands (i.e., unused areas embedded in the home range). Caloric density had the strongest negative influence on WHR size. We predict males can expand farther westward by virtue of their adaptable, sprawling home ranges that can encompass an array of resources, and their inclination to tolerate and exploit landscapes with few other bears and patchy vegetative cover, embedded with agriculture, roads, and people. Females are more limited to woodlots with natural foods and less apt to be located in open treeless expanses. However, we observed wide year-to-year variations in food production and found that during the most favorable conditions, females could be enticed farther westward, although it is unclear whether they would settle in an environment with even less tree cover than in the current extremity of their range.","Ditmer, Mark A.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Does the presence of a robot co-worker influence the performance of humans around it? Studies of motor contagions during human-robot interactions have examined either how the observation of a robot affects a human's movement velocity, or how it affects the human's movement variance, but never both together. Performance however, has to be measured considering both task speed (or frequency) as well as task accuracy. Here we examine an empirical repetitive industrial task in which a human participant and a humanoid robot work near each other. We systematically varied the robot behavior, and observed whether and how the performance of a human participant is affected by the presence of the robot. To investigate the effect of physical form, we added conditions where the robot co-worker torso and head were covered, and only the moving arm was visible to the human participants. Finally, we compared these behaviors with a human co-worker, and examined how the observed behavioral affects scale with experience of robots. Our results show that human task frequency, but not task accuracy, is affected by the observation of a humanoid robot co-worker, provided the robot's head and torso are visible.","Vasalya, Ashesh

"savedrecs (30).txt","The availability of small, lightweight tracking devices enhances our ability to study birds during mobile phases of their lives. Tree Swallows Tachycineta bicolor, a model species of wild songbird, are well-studied during their breeding season; but our understanding of their biology at other times of the year, when they are not tied to the fixed location of a nest, is more limited. We developed a lightweight radio tag with no battery (solar nanotag) to study the movements of small animals, and we deployed it to explore the behavior of Tree Swallows after the end of their summer breeding season. We tagged 32 breeding adult swallows and 36 juveniles and monitored their presence and absence at the breeding site during the post-fledging period. Although our observations are based on very small sample sizes, the tags revealed previously unknown patterns in Tree Swallow behavior during the post-breeding season. Some Tree Swallow fledglings continued to visit the site repeatedly in the months following the nesting season, with the latest detection occurring on September 30th; by contrast, all adults had permanently departed by the end of July. These results inform future hypotheses about post-breeding movements in Tree Swallows. But, more generally, the detection of tagged swallows on their distant wintering grounds, seven months after tagging, indicates the potential of studying small passerine movements throughout their entire lifetimes, and suggests a rich array of applications for these ""Life Tags"" to study the movements of small animals world-wide.","Pegan, Teresa M.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Echolocating bats are the only mammals engaging in airborne pursuit. In this paper, we implement a reactive model of sonar based prey pursuit in bats. Our simulations include a realistic prey localization mechanism as well as a model of the bat's motor behavior. In contrast to previous work, our model incorporates bats' ability to execute rapid saccadic scanning motions keeping the prey within its field of view. Decoupling the flight direction from the gaze direction allows our model to capture erratically moving prey using reactive control. We conclude that the rapid shifts in gaze direction allow bats to deal with the narrow field of view provided by their sonar system. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Vanderelst, Dieter

"savedrecs (30).txt","For migrating animals, realized migration routes and timing emerge from hundreds or thousands of movement decisions made along migration routes. Local weather conditions along migration routes continually influence these decisions, and even relatively small changes in en route weather may cumulatively result in major shifts in migration patterns. Here, we analysed satellite tracking data to score a discrete navigation decision by a large migratory bird as it navigated a high-latitude, 5000 m elevation mountain range to understand how those navigational decisions changed under different weather conditions. We showed that wind conditions in particular areas along the migration pathway drove a navigational decision to reroute a migration; conditions encountered predictably resulted in migrants routing either north or south of the mountain range. With abiotic conditions continuing to change globally, simple decisions, such as the one described here, might additively emerge into new, very different migration routes.","Eisaguirre, Joseph M.

"savedrecs (30).txt","As upper-level predators, sharks are important for maintaining marine food web structure, but populations are threatened by fishery exploitation. Sustainable management of shark populations requires improved understanding of migration patterns and population demographics, which has traditionally been sought through physical and/or electronic tagging studies. The application of natural tags such as elemental variations in mineralized band pairs of elasmobranch vertebrae cartilage could also reveal endogenous and exogenous processes experienced by sharks throughout their life histories. Here, elemental profiles were characterized in vertebrae encompassing complete life histories (birth-to-death) of shortfin mako (Isurus oxyrinchus), common thresher (Alopias vulpinus) and blue shark (Prionace glauca) of known tag and recapture locations in the eastern North Pacific Ocean. All sharks were injected with oxytetracycline at initial capture, released and subsequently recaptured, with individual liberty times ranging from 215 days to 6 years. Vertebral band pairs forming over the liberty intervals were verified by counting the number of band pairs deposited since the oxytetracycline band. Regular oscillations in vertebrae manganese (Mn) content corresponded well with the number of validated band pairs, suggesting that Mn variation could be used to age sharks. Increases in vertebrae barium concentration were correlated with times when individuals occupied areas with high coastal up welling indices, the timing and spatial intensity of which varied from year to year. Interspecific relationships were probably influenced by behavioural differences in horizontal and vertical habitat use, feeding habits and thermoregulatory physiology. These results indicate that vertebral sclerochronology has the potential to advance our knowledge of elasmobranch life history including age and growth estimation and environmental reconstruction.","Mohan, John A.

"savedrecs (30).txt","We examine the role that randomness or noise in individual motion may play in forming effective grazing strategies for herd members as they collectively move toward a destination. Through a model where animals are attracted to Voronoi neighbors as well as a destination endpoint, we show that including a significant random motion component can speed up the movement of a herd toward this destination, increase the efficiency that food is acquired during the travel, and facilitate a natural herd shape that mitigates predation risk. Specifically, if the influence of the Voronoi neighbors on individual motion is equal to the pull toward the destination, we find that optimal travel time and food consumption efficiency occurs for noise approximately twice as strong as the influence of herd members to each other, in a range of herd sizes from 10 to 100. We find that reducing the destination influence lowers this optimal noise only slightly, with random motion still exceeding the influence of neighbors. For a destination influence exceeding that of the Voronoi neighbors, an additional travel mode appears with minimal noise and aligned velocities in which the herd marches directly toward the endpoint. Our results are consistent with observational evidence of random motion in several animal groups, and motivate its generalization to traveling and grazing herds. (C) 2018 The Authors.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Future human land use and climate change may disrupt movement behaviors of terrestrial animals, thereby altering the ability of individuals to move across a landscape. Some of the expected changes result from processes whose effects will be difficult to alter, such as global climate change. We present a novel framework in which we use models to (1) identify the ecological changes from these difficult-to-alter processes, as well as (2) the potential conservation measures that are best able to compensate for these changes. We illustrated this framework with the case of an endangered caribou population in Quebec, Canada. We coupled a spatially explicit individual-based movement model with a range of landscape scenarios to assess the impacts of varying degrees of climate change, and the ability of conservation actions to compensate for such impacts on caribou movement behaviors. We found that (1) climate change impacts reduced movement potential, and that (2) the complete restoration of secondary roads inside protected areas was able to fully offset this reduction, suggesting that road restoration would be an effective compensatory conservation action. By evaluating conservation actions via landscape use simulated by an individual-based model, we were able to identify compensatory conservation options for an endangered species facing climate change.","Bauduin, Sarah

"savedrecs (30).txt","We present a non parametric extension of the conditional logit model, using Gaussian process priors. The conditional logit model is used in quantitative social science for inferring interaction effects between personal features and choice characteristics from observations of individual multinomial decisions, such as where to live, which car to buy or which school to choose. The classic, parametric model presupposes a latent utility function that is a linear combination of choice characteristics and their interactions with personal features. This imposes strong and unrealistic constraints on the form of individuals' preferences. Extensions using non-linear basis functions derived from the original features can ameliorate this problem but at the cost of high model complexity and increased reliance on the user in model specification. In this paper we develop a non-parametric conditional logit model based on Gaussian process logit models. We demonstrate its application on housing choice data from over 50,000 moving households from the Stockholm area over a two year period to reveal complex homophilic patterns in income, ethnicity and parental status.","Mann, Richard P.

"savedrecs (30).txt","BackgroundWhile many species have suffered from the detrimental impacts of increasing human population growth, some species, such as cougars (Puma concolor), have been observed using human-modified landscapes. However, human-modified habitat can be a source of both increased risk and increased food availability, particularly for large carnivores. Assessing preferential use of the landscape is important for managing wildlife and can be particularly useful in transitional habitats, such as at the wildland-urban interface. Preferential use is often evaluated using resource selection functions (RSFs), which are focused on quantifying habitat preference using either a temporally static framework or researcher-defined temporal delineations. Many applications of RSFs do not incorporate time-varying landscape availability or temporally-varying behavior, which may mask conflict and avoidance behavior.MethodsContemporary approaches to incorporate landscape availability into the assessment of habitat selection include spatio-temporal point process models, step selection functions, and continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) models; in contrast with the other methods, the CTMC model allows for explicit inference on animal movement in continuous-time. We used a hierarchical version of the CTMC framework to model speed and directionality of fine-scale movement by a population of cougars inhabiting the Front Range of Colorado, U.S.A., an area exhibiting rapid population growth and increased recreational use, as a function of individual variation and time-varying responses to landscape covariates.ResultsWe found evidence for individual- and daily temporal-variability in cougar response to landscape characteristics. Distance to nearest kill site emerged as the most important driver of movement at a population-level. We also detected seasonal differences in average response to elevation, heat loading, and distance to roads. Motility was also a function of amount of development, with cougars moving faster in developed areas than in undeveloped areas.ConclusionsThe time-varying framework allowed us to detect temporal variability that would be masked in a generalized linear model, and improved the within-sample predictive ability of the model. The high degree of individual variation suggests that, if agencies want to minimize human-wildlife conflict management options should be varied and flexible. However, due to the effect of recursive behavior on cougar movement, likely related to the location and timing of potential kill-sites, kill-site identification tools may be useful for identifying areas of potential conflict.","Buderman, Frances E.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Large numbers of juvenile southern bluefin tuna (SBT; Thunnus maccoyii) migrate into the warm shelf waters of the Great Australian Bight (GAB) each austral summer. Whilst in the GAB, they aggregate in schools that spend substantial periods in the surface layer of the water column. In this study we investigate biological, temporal and environmental factors influencing this surfacing phenomena using an extensive archival tagging dataset collected between 1998 and 2011. High frequency data on the vertical movement of SBT collected by these tags were used to calculate the proportion of time fish spent in the shallowest 20 m during each day and night period. Estimates of fish location derived from light sensor data on the tags allowed us to investigate the influence that local environmental conditions had on a fish's surfacing behaviour. Although there is high variability in surfacing behaviour within and between individuals, some general patterns emerge. There are clear diel differences in surfacing, with the proportion of time fish spend at the surface tending to be high during most days and either very high (> 90%) or very low (< 10%) during most nights. Complex relationships were found between surfacing behaviour and the environmental variables considered (sea surface temperature, chlorophyll, salinity and wind speed). The results from this study have relevance to the commercial purse-seine fishery targeting surface schools of SBT in the GAB during the austral summer, as well as the scientific aerial survey conducted each summer that collects data on sightings of surface schools of SBT in order to derive a relative abundance index used directly in management.","Eveson, J.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Large numbers of juvenile southern bluefin tuna (SBT; Thunnus maccoyii) migrate into the warm shelf waters of the Great Australian Bight (GAB) each austral summer. Whilst in the GAB, they are the focus of a commercially important Australian fishery. Recent expansion of activities associated with oil and gas exploration in the GAB over the last five years has raised concerns that noise associated with geophysical surveys and exploratory drilling activities may impact on the migration and behaviour of SBT, with potential flow-on effects on the commercial fishery and current monitoring of the population for management purposes.
As a first step in identifying the potential impacts of expansion of oil and gas exploration activities in the GAB on SBT, we establish the historical extent of these activities in the GAB with a primary focus on geophysical surveys. Potential overlap with the distribution of juvenile SBT in the GAB determined from an archival tag dataset (1998-2011) was then explored. Geophysical surveys have occurred throughout the vast majority of the region since 1960, with the size of energy sources used in surveys and the extent of areas surveyed increasing through time. The use of more complex, higher density 3D surveys has increased gradually since 2000. The timing and distribution of exploration activity has had varying degrees of overlap with SBT occurrence and distribution as described by tagged fish.
Determining robust measures of the responses to surveys however, is difficult due to a paucity of data on the hearing capabilities of SBT, uncertainties in the true extent of spatial overlap of activities and tagged fish resulting from geolocation methods used for position estimation from archival tag data, complexities in the drivers of behaviour in SBT, and limitations with using observational data to determine cause-and-effect relationships. These difficulties are typical not just of SBT and the GAB region, but apply to investigations of the responses of marine animals to geophysical surveys more broadly. The data presented in this study, however, represent a first step towards understanding oil and gas exploration within a defined region of the Australian marine environment, and provide important context for exploring the potential impact of such activities on a commercially important top order predator of the GAB ecosystem.","Evans, Karen

"savedrecs (30).txt","It is established that radiation forces can be used to transport ultrasound contrast agents, particularly for molecular imaging applications. However, the ability to model and control this process in the context of therapeutic ultrasound is limited by a paucity of data on the translational dynamics of encapsulated microbubbles under the influence of longer pulses. In this work, the translation of individual microbubbles, isolated with optical tweezers, was experimentally investigated over a range of diameters (1.8-8.8 mu m, n = 187) and pressures (25, 50, 100, 150, and 200 kPa) with millisecond pulses. Data were compared with theoretical predictions of the translational dynamics, assessing the role of shell and history force effects. A pronounced feature of the displacement curves was an effective threshold size, below which there was only minimal translation. At higher pressures (>= 150 kPa) a noticeable structure emerged where multiple local maxima occurred as a function of bubble size. The ability to accurately capture these salient features depended on the encapsulation model employed. In low Reynolds number conditions (i. e., low pressures, or high pressures, off-resonance) the inclusion of history force more accurately fit the data. After pulse cessation, bubbles exhibited substantial displacements consistent with the influence of history effects. (C) 2018 Acoustical Society of America.","Acconcia, Christopher N.

Speech rhythm was parameterized by means of the percentage over which speech is vocalic (%V) in the German pronoun ""sie"" [zi:]. The findings support the hypothesis: all else being equal, idiosyncratic %V values behaved proportionally to a speaker's tongue movement area.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Conspecific individuals often consistently differ in their behavioral responses to specific exogenous stimuli. Such individual differences in ""personality"" have been shown to be heritable, suggesting that selection maintains variation in personality. However, survival selection on a major personality trait, antipredator behavior, and its sex-dependency, has been seldom measured in the wild. Here, we found that yearling barn swallows (Hirundo rustica) showed consistency in agitation upon repeated exposure to a restraint-handling protocol, probably reflecting antipredator behavior, and that males were more agitated than females. Females that exhibited larger antipredator behavior were more likely to survive until the next breeding season with no variation among 3 study years nor across 7 breeding colonies, suggesting that variation in antipredator behavior is not maintained by spatiotemporal variation in viability selection on antipredator behavior. In both sexes, the intensity of melanin-based ventral plumage coloration positively covaried with antipredator behavior, consistent with previous observations from diverse vertebrate species. In some barn swallow populations, male coloration is targeted by directional intersexual selection, suggesting that melanization signals antipredator behavior to prospecting females and that sexual selection for antipredator behavior, or other correlated personality traits, can drive the evolution of sexual color dimorphism in barn swallows. Thus, we showed that viability selection occurs on antipredator behavior and that spatiotemporal variation in selection has no major role in promoting variation in antipredator behavior. More melanized individuals were more agitated, implying that melanization may signal personality in a sexual communication context in a species where male coloration is an epigamic trait.","Costanzo, Alessandra

"savedrecs (30).txt","Identifying where fish inhabit is a fundamentally important topic in ecology and management allowing acoustically sensitive times and areas to be prioritized. Passive acoustic localization has the benefit of being a non-invasive and non-destructive observational tool, and provides unbiased data on the position and movement of aquatic animals. This study used the time difference of arrivals (TDOA) of sound recordings on a four-hydrophone array to pinpoint the location of male oyster toadfish, Opsanus tau, a cryptic fish that produces boatwhistles to attract females. Coupling the TDOA method with cross correlation of the different boatwhistles, individual toadfish were mapped during dawn (0523-0823), midday (1123-1423), dusk (1723-2023) and night (2323 - 0223) to examine the relationship between temporal and spatial trends. Seven individual males were identified within 0.5-24.2 m of the hydrophone array and 0.0-18.2 m of the other individuals. Uncertainty in passive acoustics localization was investigated using computer simulations as < 2.0 m within a bearing of 033 to 148 degrees of the linear hydrophone array. Passive acoustic monitoring is presented as a viable tool for monitoring the positions of soniferous species, like the oyster toadfish. The method used in this study could be applied to a variety of soniferous fishes, without disturbing them or their environment. Understanding the location of fishes can be linked to temporal and environmental parameters to investigate ecological trends, as well as to vessel activity to discuss how individuals' respond to anthropogenic noise.","Putland, R.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Many habitat selection studies have focused on the importance of spatiotemporal scales and sample size, yet often hidden within is a trade-off between using more animal locations versus more predictive covariates. Few have evaluated the outcome of choosing between these two different paths even though the trade-off can have significant impacts on the conclusions drawn from habitat modeling. We evaluated the covariate resolution versus relocation trade-off across multiple spatiotemporal scales by building habitat selection models using a data-mining approach with 22 years of VHF collar data from the Denali Caribou Herd. We asked whether caribou selected winter habitat based on forage resources after accounting for snow depth. Habitat selection models at three temporal scales (decadal, inter-annual and intra-annual) provide correlative evidence of active selection for winter forage. Based on model performance and predicted occupancy, we found that acquiring appropriate covariate layers is critical and likely even more important than using more animal locations. Based on analyses that utilized more covariates, caribou predominantly selected high graminoid cover, their second most important winter food, over areas with high lichen cover, their primary winter food, at all spatial scales implying a need to balance food quality and accessibility. However, habitat selection differed between temporal scales. Two years in a row, caribou switched to flatter areas with higher lichen cover and low shrub cover while intra-annual variation in habitat selection showed caribou congregated in areas of higher lichen cover and lower snow depths as winter progressed. We conclude that large patches of tussock tundra are high-use areas for wintering caribou in Denali at decadal scales while lichen-rich areas were used at inter-annual and intra-annual temporal scales. Lower snow levels in the future may allow heavier use of lichen woodlands but increased wildfire activity and shrub encroachment may counteract increased lichen availability in woodlands.","Nelson, Peter R.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Exogenous stimuli modify larval behaviors and mediate an individual's vertical position in the water column. Larvae (stages-1, -3 and -5) of the commercially important Florida stone crab, Menippe mercenaria, were used to determine if (i) individuals elicited a response to gravity (geotaxis), hydrostatic pressure and light, (ii) those responses underlie depth regulation and (iii) those responses change during larval development. All larval stages were negatively buoyant. Stages-1 and -3 larvae elicited a negative geotaxis that promoted upward swimming, while stage-5 larvae elicited behaviors that would position individuals at depth. During relative increases in pressure all larval stages tested swam up, while pressure decreases resulted in downward movement. Light intensities that mimicked an angular light distribution resulted in a negative phototaxis among all stages with stages-1 and -3 larvae being more sensitive than stage-5 larvae. These results indicate that the responses to exogenous stimuli in stone crab larvae function as a negative feedback mechanism for depth maintenance and change throughout ontogeny. The responses observed in stages-1 and -3 larvae suggest an overall shallower distribution while the shift in the sensitivity and orientation in stage-5 larvae likely positions individuals deeper in the water column, where sublittoral flow will facilitate transport toward settlement habitats.","Gravinese, Philip M.","Gravinese, PM",NA,"643","[Gravinese, Philip M.] Florida Inst Technol, Dept Biol Sci, 150 W Univ Blvd, Melbourne, FL 32901 USA./[Gravinese, Philip M.] Mote Marine Lab, Fisheries Ecol & Enhancement Program, 1600 Ken Thompson Pkwy, Sarasota, FL 34236 USA.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"stone crab; larval behavior; hydrostatic pressure; geotaxis;

"savedrecs (30).txt","The balance between resource acquisition and risk avoidance should vary according to personality type, with potential knock-on effects for fitness. Although previous studies have suggested a link between boldness and fitness components, little evidence is available on the behavioural mechanisms mediating this relationship in the wild. Because habitat use is the outcome of the trade-off between the costs and benefits associated with using each habitat type, we evaluated between-individual differences in habitat use of 64 GPS-collared female roe deer, Capreolus capreolus, using multinomial logit mixed models. To investigate whether deer differed in their habitat use tactics in relation to their personality type and their annual reproductive success, we assessed the link between individual habitat use patterns, boldness (measured as the strength of behavioural responsiveness to handling) and annual reproductive success (measured by the presence/absence of fawns at heel during autumn). Although daily and seasonal variations in the risk-resource landscapes clearly drove patterns of habitat use, individuals adopted contrasting habitat use tactics depending on their position along the shy-bold gradient and their reproductive status. Shy individuals occupied safer woodland more frequently, even at night when risk is lower. In contrast, bold individuals were better able to exploit rich open habitats. When this included mature autumn crops, these females weaned more offspring. Finally, irrespective of personality type, females that used meadows more often also achieved higher annual reproductive success. Overall, we demonstrate that individuals express divergent habitat use tactics as a function of their ability to avoid exposure to risk and their annual reproductive success.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Many animals use alarm calls in intraspecific communication to warn conspecifics of a predator's presence or to elicit coordinated group responses. However, alarm calls may also be aimed directly at the predator to discourage further pursuit. These 'pursuit-deterrent' signals are particularly important in the presence of ambush predators that rely on stealth to hunt prey. Here, we conducted playback experiments over a 16-month period on radiocollared ocelots, Leopardus pardalis, in Peru using audio stimuli of titi monkey (Callicebus toppini) and saki monkey (Pithecia rylandsi) alarm calls, with nonalarm loud calls as controls. We predicted that, if titi and saki alarm calls function as deterrent signals, then ocelots would move away from the sound source and leave the area following exposure to alarms but not following controls. We tracked ocelots via radiotelemetry for 30 min prior to and 30 min following experiments. At 15 min intervals we noted subject location, whether the cat was stationary or moving towards, away from or parallel to the playback area (calculated using a deflection angle) and distance travelled. Results showed a significantly different pattern in response movement between playback trials; ocelots moved away from the sound source in the majority of alarm trials but remained stationary/hidden or moved in a variety of directions following control trials. Ocelots also moved significantly farther following exposure to alarm trials than following exposure to controls. We conclude that ocelots can distinguish alarm calls from other loud calls and are deterred by alarm-calling monkeys. This is the first study to use playbacks on wild predators to test the pursuit-deterrent function of primate alarm calls. (C) 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Simple Summary Free-range laying hens can choose to be indoors or outdoors. Individual hens vary in their ranging choice and this behaviour could also be affected by their flock mates. Radio-frequency identification tracking of individual hens in experimental free-range pens with group sizes of 46-50 hens was used to study flock ranging patterns. Across the day, hens moved through the range pop-holes in the same direction as other hens above levels expected by random chance, termed pop-hole-following'. Hens were also simultaneously indoors or outdoors with other specific hens more often than expected by random chance, termed hen-pair association'. Chicks that were provided variable stimulatory and structural enrichments from 4 to 21 days showed higher pop-hole-following and hen-pair association than non-enriched birds. The individual birds within these small hen groups were behaving primarily as a cohesive flock which has implications for understanding the group-level behaviour of hens. Further research would analyse if similar social movement patterns were present in larger commercial free-range flocks and how early rearing environments may affect adult social behaviour.
Abstract Free-range laying hen systems provide individuals a choice between indoor and outdoor areas where range use may be socially influenced. This study used radio-frequency identification technology to track the ranging of individually-tagged hens housed in six experimental free-range pens from 28 to 38 weeks of age (46-50 hens/pen). All daily visits to the range were used to study group behaviour. Results showed that 67.6% (SD = 5.0%) of all hen movements through the pop-holes outdoors or indoors were following the movement of another hen (pop-hole-following') compared to only 50.5% of movements in simulated random data. The percentage overlap in time that all combinations of hen pairs within each pen spent simultaneously outdoors or indoors showed a median value of overlap greater than the 90th percentile of random data. Pens housing hens that had been provided variable enrichments from 4 to 21 days (n = 3 pens) showed higher pop-hole-following' behaviour and a higher percentage of hen-pair association compared to hens reared in non-enriched conditions (n = 3 pens). These results show that birds in each free-range pen were primarily a cohesive flock and early enrichment improved this social cohesiveness. These results have implications for understanding free-range flock-level behaviour.","Campbell, Dana L. M.

The Cat Tracker citizen science project was conducted in South Australia to better understand domestic cats, their movement, and related community views. The project was deliberately designed to engage cat owners and assist them to make informed decisions about the management of their pet cats. The project collected data through an online social survey and tracking of pet cats, using small GPS units. This study evaluates the project and examines its impact on participant knowledge, attitude, and behaviour. We found that participation in the tracking activity had positive learning outcomes for cat owners and that, after participating, many cat owners placed an increased level of importance on containing cats. Participants reported that they changed their behaviour with existing pet cats and reported intentions to change behaviour with future pet cats. We discuss positive impacts on other members of the community, and how negative impacts may be avoided. We advocate for further research in this area to understand how projects can drive positive changes in knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours.
Abstract Domestic cats (Felis catus) are popular pets worldwide and play an important role in the lives of many of their owners; however, there is growing awareness of the potential negative impacts of cats. Accordingly, there is increasing interest in pet cat management, including changing the attitudes and behaviours of cat owners. The Cat Tracker citizen science project was conducted in South Australia to better understand domestic cats, their movement, and related community views. The project was deliberately designed to engage cat owners and assist them to make informed decisions about the management of their pet cats. The project collected data through an online social survey (n = 3192) and GPS tracking of pet cats (n = 428), conducted between February 2015 and September 2016. A public report was published in February 2017 and an evaluation survey (n = 410) was conducted between March and May 2017. This study evaluates the project and examines its impact on participant knowledge, attitude, and behaviour. We found that participation in the tracking activity had a statistically significant influence on participant-reported learning. For participant cat owners, we recorded statistically significant increases in the level of importance placed on containing cats (both during the day and at night). Participants reported that they changed their behaviour with existing pet cats and reported intentions to change behaviour with future pet cats. We discuss impacts beyond what we set out to measure, including impacts on project onlookers, profound impacts on participants, and how the rebound effect (which can generate negative impacts) may be avoided. We describe social science applied to citizen science and advocate for further research in this area to understand how projects can drive positive changes in knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours.","Roetman, Philip

"savedrecs (30).txt","Simple Summary While many people have great affection for southern hairy-nosed wombats, they are also considered by others to be an agricultural pest, because of the damage they can cause to farmland and agricultural infrastructure. Therefore, we need to have a good understanding of how many wombats there might be and how the population is changing, if we are to make properly informed decisions on how to best manage them. Unfortunately, because wombats are nocturnal and live underground, and because they use a number of different burrows throughout their home ranges, counting them can be difficult. We used motion-activated cameras to record how often wombats use each burrow in order to develop a reliable method of counting wombats that we can apply at the broad scale. We found that, on average, there are around 0.43 wombats for each active burrow. The use of video cameras to record this information provided a much simpler and less invasive means of researching wombat behaviour than methods such as trapping. However, video cameras do have limitations that need to be considered, and researchers need to fully understand their capabilities and limitations before employing them in the field.
Abstract Broad-scale abundance estimates of the southern hairy-nosed wombat population use a proxy measure based on counting the number of active burrows, which is multiplied by an index of wombats/active burrow'. However, the extant indices were calculated in the 1980s, prior to the use of calicivirus to control rabbits, and used invasive monitoring methods which may have affected the results. We hypothesise that the use of video might provide a logistically simple, non-invasive means of calculating updated indices. To this end, motion-activated, infra-red still and video cameras were placed at various distances outside active wombat burrows in the South Australian Murraylands and Eyre Peninsula regions. The captured imagery was inspected to determine how often the burrow was occupied by one or more wombats, and how effective the cameras were at detecting wombat activity. Video data was clearly superior to the still imagery, with more than twice as many burrow occupancies being positively identified (still: 43%). The indices of wombats/active burrow calculated based on video imagery were: Murraylands: 0.43, Eyre Peninsula: 0.42. 1948 false positive videos were recorded, of which 1674 (86%) occurred between noon and sunset.","Swinbourne, Michael J.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Light cues elicit strong responses from nearly all forms of life, perhaps most notably as circadian rhythms entrained by periods of daylight and darkness. Atypical periods of darkness, like solar eclipses, provide rare opportunities to study biological responses to light cues. By using a continental scale radar network, we investigated responses of flying animals to the total solar eclipse of 21 August 2017. We quantified the number of biological targets in the atmosphere at 143 weather radar stations across the continental United States to investigate whether the decrease in light and temperature at an atypical time would initiate a response like that observed at sunset, when activity in the atmosphere usually increases. Overall, biological activity decreased in the period leading to totality, followed by a short low-altitude spike of biological activity during totality in some radars. This pattern suggests that cues associated with the eclipse were insufficient to initiate nocturnal activity comparable to that occurring at sunset but sufficient to suppress diurnal activity.","Nilsson, Cecilia

"savedrecs (30).txt","Microtubules are filamentous tubular protein polymers which are essential for a range of cellular behaviour, and are generally straight over micron length scales. However, in some gliding assays, where microtubules move over a carpet of molecular motors, individual microtubules can also form tight arcs or rings, even in the absence of crosslinking proteins. Understanding this phenomenon may provide important explanations for similar highly curved microtubules which can be found in nerve cells undergoing neurodegeneration. We propose a model for gliding assays where the kinesins moving the microtubules over the surface induce ring formation through differential binding, substantiated by recent findings that a mutant version of the motor protein kinesin applied in solution is able to lock-in microtubule curvature. For certain parameter regimes, our model predicts that both straight and curved microtubules can exist simultaneously as stable steady states, as has been seen experimentally. Additionally, unsteady solutions are found, where a wave of differential binding propagates down the microtubule as it glides across the surface, which can lead to chaotic motion. Whilst this model explains two-dimensional microtubule behaviour in an experimental gliding assay, it has the potential to be adapted to explain pathological curling in nerve cells.","Pearce, Simon P.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Adult Atlantic salmon (Salmo solar) return to natal rivers several months before spawning and during summer can be subjected to temperatures that exceed their upper temperature tolerance limits. Salmon use thermal refuges to minimize exposure to high temperatures, but little information exists regarding behavioral thermoregulation by adult Atlantic salmon. We examined behavioral thermoregulation by Atlantic salmon during summer in-river residence in a Quebec river with a novel combination of thermal infrared remote sensing, river temperature monitoring, and acoustic telemetry. Adults engaged in behavioural thermoregulation at cooler ambient river temperatures (17-19 degrees C) than previously recorded for this species and maintained body temperature within a narrow range (16-20 degrees C) via use of cool and warm refuges. Adults used large, stable, stratified pools as refuges, allowing multiple individuals to thermoregulate simultaneously without leaving the pool. Low river discharge and high temperatures can be physical barriers to salmon migration, preventing them from accessing suitable refuges (e.g., pools). Identifying and maintaining connectivity to thermal refuges may be critical for persistence of Atlantic salmon populations as climate changes and rivers warm.","Frechette, Danielle M.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Long-distance migrations by ungulate species are a globally imperiled natural phenomenon and conservation of them requires monitoring population vital rates. Satellite telemetry tracking is widely used for understanding the spatial distribution and movement of animals, especially migratory animals in remote environments. Recently, analytical methods have been developed to infer parturition events from movement data in multiple species that calve in isolation, but to date such methods have not been tested on animals that both migrate and spatially aggregate during calving. We applied two movement-based methods developed to infer parturition in nonmigratory woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou (Gmelin, 1788)) to 241 reproductive seasons spanning 6 years of GPS data from migratory barren-ground caribou (Rangifer tarandus grunti J.A. Allen, 1902). We compared results from both methods to data from aerial surveys of collared females during the calving period. We found that each movement-based method had similar to 80% overall accuracy to identify calving events, with interannual variation ranging from 61% to 100%. When we considered instances when the two analytical methods agreed on parturition outcome, the accuracy increased to 89% with an annual range of 73%-100%. Using these methods, we identified marked interannual differences in peak calving dates and higher parturition rates than previously reported for this caribou herd. The successful application of these analyses to a migratory, gregarious ungulate suggests a broader applicability of the methodology.","Cameron, Matthew D.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Seed hoarding animals may distinctly impact individual fitness of plants as well as plant community dynamics in terms of differential seed consumption and seed dispersal. Addressing methodological challenges and constraints in understanding the role of seed dispersal mutualisms, we tested different seed tagging methods for relatively small seeds. We selected two study areas with dense ground vegetation, irregular terrain, and seed predator guilds with comparatively high dispersal and seed removal potential. We tested three different tagging methods, offering untagged and tagged seeds on experimental dishes: (1) wire threads with plastic flags fixed with solvent-free glue, (2) wire threads with plastic flags twisted around a beechnut, (3) and radio-transmitters fixed with solvent-free glue. Seed predators did not show any preferences for tagged or untagged seeds or for a certain tagging method at any point of time. Instead, both tagged seeds and untagged control seeds were removed from the dishes to a high degree (up to 100%) after 25-35days. In both study areas, seeds with radio-transmitters experienced longer transport distances with a maximum of nearly 60m and distances also differed between study areas. In one study area, higher portions of radio-tagged seeds could be recovered than for the flag-tagged seeds. Significantly more seeds tagged with radio-transmitters were cached than expected. Given the advantages and limitations of each approach, a combination of flag-tagging and radio-telemetry (not on the same seed) may be the best solution for tracking seed fate in dense vegetation or irregular terrain.","Kempter, Iris

"savedrecs (30).txt","Examining the ways in which animals use habitat and select resources to satisfy their life history requirements has important implications for ecology, evolution, and conservation. The advent of radio-tracking in the mid-20th century greatly expanded the scope of animal-habitat modeling. Thereafter, it became common practice to aggregate telemetry data collected on a number of tagged individuals and fit one model describing resource selection at the population level. This convention, however, runs the risk of masking important individuality in the nature of associations between animals and their environment. Here, we investigated the importance of individual variation in animal-habitat relationships via the study of a highly gregarious species. We modeled elk (Cervus elaphus) location data, collected from Global Positioning System (GPS) collars, using Bayesian discrete choice resource selection function (RSF) models. Using a high-performance computing cluster, we batch-processed these models at the level of each individual elk (n = 88) and evaluated the output with respect to: (a) the composition of parameters in the most supported models, (b) the estimates of the parameters featured in the global models, and (c) spatial maps of the predicted relative probabilities of use. We detected considerable individual variation across all three metrics. For instance, the most supported models varied with respect to parameter composition with a range of seven to 17 and an average of 14.4 parameters per individual elk. The estimates of the parameters featured in the global models also varied greatly across individual elk with little conformity detected across age or sex classes. Finally, spatial mapping illustrated stark differences in the predicted relative probabilities of use across individual elk. Our analysis identifies that animal-habitat relationships, even among the most gregarious of species, can be highly variable. We discuss the implications of our results for ecology and present some guiding principles for the development of RSF models at the individual-animal level.","Montgomery, Robert A.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Anthropogenic and natural habitat fragmentation inhibit movement of animals through landscapes. An important challenge for connectivity conservation is determining which conditions facilitate or limit movements, so that these areas can be prioritized for protection or restoration. We examine Canada lynx Lynx canadensis habitat connectivity in the fragmented North Cascade Mountains of Washington, as an example of a highly mobile species that is specialized both on prey and in habitat needs. We identify lynx Habitat Concentration Areas based on Core Habitat Models, parameterize resistance surfaces from our Matrix Habitat Model, and develop linkages of habitat lynx use to move between patches of high quality habitat. We identify a number of linkages for lynx comprised of habitat conditions that differed from high quality core patches identified from our habitat modeling. Radio-locations from lynx confirm lower-quality habitats of low resistance to movement were used by traveling lynx. Our results thus suggest traveling lynx do indeed use a much broader range of habitats than do lynx moving within core areas. For lynx in the North Cascades, our results show that maintaining connectivity will require preserving habitats and linkages that would previously have been deemed unsuitable for lynx. Maintaining connectivity for lynx is particularly important given the many recent large wildfires in this region that have reduced the number of mature forest stands that form prime habitat for lynx. Policy implications. Our results strongly suggest that habitat connectivity models should be based on empirical information of animal location data and focused on matrix habitat analysis. Traveling predators use a wide suite of habitats, resulting in more and broader linkage zones that should inform conservation efforts. Failure to identify these areas of functional connectivity could result in the oversight of usable linkage zones, leaving them without protection and vulnerable to degradation.","Vanbianchi, Carmen

"savedrecs (30).txt","Dispersal, defined as any movements potentially leading to gene flow, is a major process driving a species' capacity to cope with human-induced environmental modifications. However, the dispersal process is multi-causal, which currently hinders predictions regarding a species' resilience to global change. We used a multifaceted approach to disentangle the relative importance of a suite of dispersal-related factors in the butterfly Lycaena tityrus, including condition- (morphology and behavior) and context- (environmental) dependent factors. Experiments were conducted at an experimental platform dedicated to study dispersal, the Metatron, to record emigration propensity in two-patch experimental metapopulations under different environmental conditions. The butterflies' individual condition was subsequently assessed in the laboratory. Individual condition did not generally influence emigration propensity. We detected a significant sex bias in emigration propensity, being generally higher in females than in males, but in a context-dependent manner. The environmental context affected emigration propensity, which was higher when habitat quality was poor. Our results show that emigration is not random in L. tityrus, but is rather an active process triggered by sex and habitat quality. Our main finding was that individual condition, and particularly flight ability measured by a performance test, was not related to emigration propensity in experimental metapopulations. Our results may have important implications for forecasting future species distributions, as deteriorating environmental contexts are likely to increase emigration whatever the individual condition is.","Reim, Elisabeth

"savedrecs (30).txt","Enhancing our understanding of fish dispersal is central to the success of modern-day conservation efforts in freshwater ecosystems. However, methods seeking to estimate dispersal are diverse; ranging from direct estimation of individual movements, computation of dispersal kernels, to indirect assessment using measures of gene flow across riverscapes. An important question is whether results from these different approaches provide a consistent picture of the spatial scales of dispersal. Here, we performed a review and meta-analysis of the literature reporting both individual movements and genetic data to characterize patterns of dispersal for riverine fishes globally. Across all the studies considered (N-direct=206; N-indirect=205), our results suggest restricted magnitudes of dispersal for riverine fishes, but highlight a large heterogeneity among species, taxonomic orders and geographies. For instance, we found that the maximum parent-offspring dispersal distances varied from 69m to 1,086km (median=12km; N-species=107), whereas the dispersal spread derived from isolation-by-distance slopes (sigma(IBD)) from genetic data ranged from 19m to 250km (median=1km; N-species=56). Comparisons of species-specific values also revealed significant and positive relationships between direct and indirect estimates of dispersal distances, indicating that organismal movement ability often translates into effective transmission of genes. Finally, this global overview pointed to important geographic and taxonomic disparities in the study of dispersal for riverine fishes. We thus encourage researchers to broaden the taxonomic and geographical scope of future investigations and identify emerging research frontiers where new scientific efforts are needed.","Comte, Lise

"savedrecs (30).txt","Modem management of multifunctional woodlands must address many and various demands, including for recreation, timber production and the conservation of biodiversity. The responses of individuals and populations of protected species to woodland management and habitat change are often not well understood. Using radio-tracking and LiDAR, we investigated the short-term habitat preferences of hazel dormice Muscardinus avellanarius, and their ranging and resting behaviours before and after small-scale tree felling, following a before-after control-impact design. Mean dormouse home range size was 0.51 Ha ( +/- 0.07 SE, n = 16) and did not vary between sexes or among sites, though heavier animals had smaller ranges. Dormice preferred mid-height woodland habitat (5-10 m tall), with low proportions of high forest (over 10 m tall), for both ranging and resting sites. Ranging habitats were often located on woodland edges and relatively dense vegetation. Dormice preferentially used yew, rowan and hazel during ranging. There was no difference in the distances travelled by dormice before and after felling, but dormice in areas where trees had been felled showed less evidence of a shift in ranging area than those in unfelled areas. Although the limited response of dormice to tree felling activities has the potential to be associated with increased mortality and/or limited dispersal of individual dormice, the requirements of dormice for mid-successional and edge habitats that arise after tree removal means that a dynamic optimum of felling and regeneration is essential for conservation of dormouse populations.","Goodwin, Cecily E.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Fisheries produce large quantities of discards, an important resource for scavenging seabirds. However, a policy reform banning discards, which is soon to be implemented within the EU, will impose a food shortage upon scavengers, and it is still largely unknown how scavengers will behave. We studied the diet (hard remains), trophic (stable isotope analysis), and foraging (individual tracking) ecology of two gull species breeding in sympatry: Audouin's gull Larus audouinii (AG) and yellow-legged gull Larus michahellis (YLG), in South Portugal, under normal fishery activity (NFA; work days) and low fishery activity (LFA; weekends), over two consecutive years. We established a pattern of dietary, spatial, and temporal segregation between the two gull species. Under LFA, yellow-legged gulls reduced their time spent at-sea, thus foraging more in alternative habitats (e. g. refuse dumps) and widening their isotopic niche (i. e. generalist behaviour). Contrastingly, Audouin's gull had a narrower trophic niche (i. e. specialist behaviour), foraging exclusively at-sea, reducing the amount of demersal fish and increasing the amount of pelagic fish in their diet. Under NFA, both species foraged mostly at-sea, feeding almost exclusively on fish, with increased consumption of demersal species (i. e. fishery discards). In general, yellow-legged gull had a broader trophic niche (i. e. generalist behaviour) when compared with the narrower isotopic niche of Audouin's gull (i.e. specialist behaviour). Overall, both gull species relied heavily on fishery discards. However, there was visible dietary, spatial, and temporal segregation between the two species, associated with their dietary and habitat preferences that could be attributed to the availability of anthropogenic resources, such as fishery discards.","Matos, Diana M.

"savedrecs (30).txt","There are substantial benefits to potential fitness conferred to animals that undertake migrations. However, animals must make compromises to maximize survival and compensate for the risks associated with long-distance movement. European eel (Anguilla anguilla), a migratory catadromous fish, has undergone population declines owing to changes in marine and freshwater habitat and interactions with human infrastructure, instigating research to investigate the mechanisms controlling their migration. Yellow-phase European eels from the local River Opo and silver-phase European eels transplanted from River Imsa, Norway, were implanted with acoustic transmitters and released within a network of receiver stations in the Hardangerfjord, Norway. Silver-phase eels exhibited more movement within the array than yellow-phase eels, signifying the onset of migration. Silver-phase eels moved through the fjord nocturnally, arriving at gates predominantly at night. Eels had slower rates of migration than expected based on models predicting continuous movement, suggesting that movement ceased during daylight hours. Reduced net rates of travel supported the hypothesis that eels compromise speed for safety during the early marine migration by avoiding predators and not actively migrating during daylight. The silver eels were capable of directed movement towards the ocean and were not recorded by receivers in bays or dead ends. European eels must successfully transit this coastal zone, where their residence is prolonged because of the relatively slow speeds. These results suggest that the early marine phase of the European eel spawning migration be a focal period for European eel conservation efforts.","Lennox, Robert J.

"savedrecs (30).txt","The habitat use of adult Atlantic salmon was evaluated in a fjord complex in western Norway. A representative sample of 9 wild and 29 hatchery origin Atlantic salmon were tagged with acoustic tags and tracked with 28 stationary receivers from June 2012 to river entry. Using a movement-based kernel density estimation, we identified near shore habitat use in relation to a National Salmon Fjord (NSF) and adjoining aquaculture sites. Furthermore, we compared progression rates and vertical distributions among habitat units. Mean residence time for salmon with acoustic tags from marking to river entry was 30 days (range 3-83 days). Moreover, recaptures of individuals with T-bar anchor tags supported the long residency of Atlantic salmon within the fjord (0-63 days). The main habitat use occurred outside the NSF (68%), with 62% of the individuals overlapping with one or more aquaculture sites. Median progression rates ranged from 15 km d(-1) up to 42 km d(-1) among the different sections of the fjord with a mean vertical distribution <2m from the surface. Whereas direct implications from the overlap with aquaculture are unclear, the results illustrate the challenge encountered when evaluating the effectiveness of marine protected areas in close proximity to aquaculture sites.","Mahlum, Shad K.

"savedrecs (30).txt","A better understanding of the spatiotemporal variation of human pressures, such as fishing, is crucial in the framework of ecosystem-based management. In this context, the spatiotemporal patterns of fishing effort from Greek trawlers operating in the eastern Mediterranean were studied using Vessel Monitoring System data over a 6-year period (2010-2015). The exploratory analysis of the data consisted of spatial auto-correlation techniques assessing clusters of high fishing effort (hotspots). Cycles, seasonality, trends, and the inter/intra-annual persistence of hotspots were also examined. The spatiotemporal association between the fishing effort (fine-scale: 5 x 5 km, monthly basis) and environmental/economic variables (depth, chlorophyll-a, fuel price, distance from port) was investigated through Generalized Additive Modelling. The results revealed higher fishing effort at depths <250 m, at distances between 15 and 55 km from the departure port and in areas of relatively high primary productivity. In winter, fishing effort was observed in shallower waters while during mid/late spring in deeper strata. In autumn, the effort was higher than any other season. Fishing effort was negatively correlated with fuel price and a decrease was noticeable during 2012-2013, the period of fuel price peaks. Potential implications of the methodology and results on spatial planning and management are discussed.","Maina, I.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Mechanosensation is a universal feature of animals that is essential for behavior, allowing detection of animals' own body movement and position as well as physical characteristics of the environment. The extraordinary morphological and behavioral diversity that exists across fish species provide rich opportunities for comparative mechanosensory studies in fins. The fins of fishes have been found to function as proprioceptors, by providing feedback on fin ray position and movement, and as tactile sensors, by encoding pressures applied to the fin surface. Across fish species, and among fins, the afferent response is remarkably consistent, suggesting that the ability of fin rays and membrane to sense deformation is a fundamental feature of fish fins. While fin mechanosensation has been known in select, often highly specialized, species for decades, only in the last decade have we explored mechanosensation in typical propulsive fins and considered its role in behavior, particularly locomotion. In this paper, we synthesize the current understanding of the anatomy and physiology of fin mechanosensation, looking toward key directions for research. We argue that a mechanosensory perspective informs studies of fin-based propulsion and other fin-driven behaviors and should be considered in the interpretation of fin morphology and behavior. In addition, we compare the mechanosensory system innervating the fins of fishes to the systems innervating the limbs of mammals and wings of insects in order to identify shared mechanosensory strategies and how different organisms have evolved to meet similar functional challenges. Finally, we discuss how understanding the biological organization and function of fin sensors can inform the design of control systems for engineered fins and fin-driven robotics.","Aiello, Brett R.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Coordinated landing from a jump requires preparation, which must include appropriate positioning and configuration of the landing limbs and body to be successful. While well studied in mammals, our lab has been using the cane toad (Rhinella marinus) as a model for understanding the biomechanics of controlled landing in anurans, animals that use jumping or bounding as their dominant mode of locomotion. In this article, we report new results from experiments designed to explore how different modes of sensory feedback contribute to previously identified features of coordinated landing in toads. More specifically, animals in which vision, hindlimb proprioception, or vestibular feedback were removed, underwent a series of hopping trials while high-speed video was used to record and characterize limb movements and electromyographic (EMG) activity was recorded from a major elbow extensor (anconeus). Results demonstrate that altering any sensory system impacts landing behavior, though loss of vision had the least effect. Blind animals showed significant differences in anconeus EMG timing relative to controls, but forelimb and hindlimb movements as well as the ability to successfully decelerate the body using the forelimbs were not affected. Compromising hindlimb proprioception led to distinctly different forelimb kinematics. Though EMG patterns were disrupted, animals in this condition were also able to decelerate after impact, though with less control, regularly allowing their trunks to make ground contact during landing. Animals with compromised vestibular systems showed the greatest deficits, both in takeoff and landing behavior, which were highly variable and rarely coordinated. Nevertheless, animals in this condition demonstrated EMG patterns and forelimb kinematics similar to those in control animals. The fact that no ablation entirely eliminates all aspects of landing preparation suggests that its underpinnings are complex and that there is no single sensory trigger for its initiation.","Cox, S.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Larval Drosophila move up attractive chemical gradients, and down aversive ones. Although their movement is often characterized as a series of runs and directed turns, it can also be modeled as a continuous modulation of turning extent by the detected change in stimulus intensity as the animal moves through the gradient. We show that a neuromechanical model of peristaltic crawling and spontaneous bending in the larva can be adapted to produce taxis behavior by the simple addition of a local segmental reflex to modulate transverse viscosity (or ""bendiness"") proportionally to the intensity change detected in the head. Altering the gain produces weaker or stronger, negative or positive taxis, with behavioral statistics that qualitatively match the larva.","Loveless, Jane

"savedrecs (30).txt","Patterns of male reproductive allocation provide insight into life-history characteristics. The trade-offs associated with resource and female group defence are well-defined. However, less is understood about trade-offs in species that practise scramble-competition polygyny, where successful strategies may favour competitive mate-searching rather than contest competition and fighting. White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) practise scramble-competition polygyny where solitary males search for and assess receptivity of females scattered across the landscape. Physically mature males are expected to do most of the breeding because of the high energetic costs of reproduction and high social status. However, young males may collectively sire one-third of offspring. To gain a better understanding of trade-offs associated with scramble-competition polygyny, we quantified metrics associated with reproductive effort and success. We quantified changes in body mass of harvested males, energetic costs of locomotion based on movements of GPS radiocollared males and timing of reproduction via temporal genetic parentage assignments. Young males (1.5 and 2.5years old) sired offspring, but their mating success was mainly limited to peak rut, when most females were in oestrus. Furthermore, multiple paternity was common, indicating opportunistic reproduction. Reproductive effort, indexed by body mass loss, was highest in prime-age males (5.5-6.5years old). Surprisingly, young and postprime males also exhibited significant body mass loss, indicative of investment in reproductive effort. Movement rates increased twofold to fourfold during rut as a function of mate search activities, but cost of locomotion would cause only about one-third of observed body mass loss. Because males are capital breeders, we infer most of body mass loss is due to reduced foraging. In scramble-competition polygyny, the repeated location of potential mates and assessment of their oestrous status appear to be important constituents of male mating strategies. Therefore, mating success may be influenced by time management and spatial memory, and not based solely on social dominance. Thus, reproductive effort should be greater for individuals capable of reducing time foraging. For those that cannot, opportunistic mating opportunities may arise when operative adult sex ratios are low. Our analyses reveal valuable insight into the trade-offs associated with scramble-competition polygyny.","Foley, Aaron M.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Early arrival at breeding grounds is of prime importance for migrating birds as it is known to enhance breeding success. Adults, males and higher quality individuals typically arrive earlier, and across years, early arrival has been linked to warmer spring temperatures. However, the mechanisms and potential costs of early arrival are not well understood. To deepen the understanding of arrival date differences between individuals and years, we studied them in light of the preceding spring migration behaviour and atmospheric conditions en route. GPS and body acceleration (ACC) data were obtained for 35 adult white storks (Ciconia ciconia) over five years (2012-2016). ACC records were translated to energy expenditure estimates (overall dynamic body acceleration; ODBA) and to behavioural modes, and GPS fixes were coupled with environmental parameters. At the interindividual level (within years), early arrival was attributed primarily to departing earlier for migration and from more northern wintering sites (closer to breeding grounds), rather than to migration speed. In fact, early-departing birds flew slower, experienced weaker thermal uplifts and expended more energy during flight, but still arrived earlier, emphasizing the cost and the significance of early departure. Individuals that wintered further south arrived later at the breeding grounds but did not produce fewer fledglings, presumably due to positive carry-over effects of advantageous wintering conditions (increased precipitation, vegetation productivity and daylight time). Therefore, early arrival increased breeding success only after controlling for wintering latitude. Males arrived slightly ahead of females. Between years, late arrival was linked to colder temperatures en route through two different mechanisms: stronger headwinds causing slower migration and lower thermal uplifts resulting in longer stopovers. This study showed that distinct migratory properties underlie arrival time variation within and between years. It highlighted (a) an overlooked cost of early arrival induced by unfavourable atmospheric conditions during migration, (b) an important fitness trade-off in storks between arrival date and wintering habitat quality and (c) mechanistic explanations for the negative temperature-arrival date correlation in soaring birds. Such understanding of arrival time can facilitate forecasting migrating species responses to climate changes.","Rotics, Shay

"savedrecs (30).txt","The pressure-based noseband sensor system (RWS: RumiWatch System; ITIN + HOCH GmbH Feeding Technology, Liestal, Switzerland) has recently been validated for the measurement of rumination time in mature cows. We aimed in this study at developing a similar pressure-based system for monitoring rumination in young dairy calves. To this end, a vegetable oil-filled silicon tube with a built-in pressure sensor (outer diameter 5.7 mm, length 38 cm) was attached to the noseband of a calf halter. In contrast to the RWS developed for mature cows, the accelerometer, the battery, the data logger, and the SD card of the RWS were integrated into 1 box to reduce the weight of the RWS to 0.35 kg. The box was attached to the halter so that it was located behind the right ear of the calf. Ten pre-weaned German Holstein calves (49-106 kg BW and 33-63 days of age) were equipped with the RWS. Calves were milk-fed thrice a day and offered hay and commercial starter for ad libitum intake. In parallel, animals were monitored by a video camera connected to a video recorder for 12 h. Two independent observers assessed the video records to obtain a reliable gold standard for the evaluation of the newly developed RWS. Data obtained by either RWS or visual video observation were processed as min rumination per h, yielding a total of 120 pairs of values (12 pairs per animal) for regression analysis. Assessment of 2 independent observers were highly correlated (r = 0.99). Results indicated relatively low random error between results obtained from the RWS (on y-axis) and video observations (on x-axis) (R-2 = 0.82). However, the intercept of the regression line (y = 7.70 + 0.64 x) was significantly different from zero (P < 0.01) and the 95% confidence interval of the slope (0.79-0.94) did not include the value of 1. This translates to a significant systemic error resulting in overestimation of rumination time which is attributable to nutritive and nonnutritive oral activities that almost exclusively lasted for up to 10 min. Exclusion of false positive rumination signals lasting less than 10 or 5 consecutive min from the analysis reduced the random and systemic errors of the model (R-2 = 0.86 and 0.93, respectively). We conclude that the newly developed RWS can be used to provide accurate measurement of rumination time in young calves. However, an extra programmed algorithm in the evaluation software is recommended to make the system more user-friendly for measurements on calves.","Eslamizad, Mehdi

"savedrecs (30).txt","1. Fencing is one of the most common methods of mitigating human-wildlife conflicts. At the same time, fencing is considered one of the most pressing threats emerging in conservation globally. Although fences act as barriers and can cause population isolation and fragmentation over time, it is difficult to quantitatively predict the consequences fences have for wildlife.
2. Here, we model how fencing designed to mitigate human-elephant conflict (HEC) on the Borderlands between Kenya and Tanzania will affect functional connectivity and movement corridors for African elephants. Specifically, we (a) model functional landscape connectivity integrating natural and anthropogenic factors; (b) predict seasonal movement corridors used by elephants in non-protected areas; and (c) evaluate whether fencing in one area can potentially intensify human-wildlife conflicts elsewhere.
3. We used GPS movement and remote sensing data to develop monthly step-selection functions to model functional connectivity. For future scenarios, we used an ongoing fencing project designed for HEC mitigation within the study area. We modelled movement corridors using least-cost path and circuit theory methods, evaluated their predictive power and quantified connectivity changes resulting from the planned fencing.
4. Our results suggest that fencing will not cause landscape fragmentation and will not change functional landscape connectivity dramatically. However, fencing will lead to a loss of connectivity locally and will increase the potential for HEC in new areas. We estimate that wetlands, important for movement corridors, will be more intensively used by the elephants, which may also cause problems of overgrazing. Seasonal analysis highlights an increasing usage of non-protected lands in the dry season and equal importance of the pinch point wetlands for preserving overall function connectivity.
5. Synthesis and applications. Fencing is a solution to small-scale human-elephant conflict problems but will not solve the issue at a broader scale. Moreover, our results highlight that it may intensify the conflicts and overuse of habitat patches in other areas, thereby negating conservation benefits. If fencing is employed on a broader scale, then it is imperative that corridors are integrated within protected area networks to ensure local connectivity of affected species.","Osipova, Liudmila

"savedrecs (30).txt","1. Broad-scale land conversions and fertilizer use have dramatically altered the available staging area for herbivorous long-distance migrants. Instead of natural land, these birds rely increasingly on pastures for migratory fuelling and stopover, often conflicting with farming practices. To predict and manage birds' future habitat use, the relative advantages and disadvantages of natural (e.g. saltmarsh, intertidal) versus anthropogenic staging sites for foraging need to be understood.
2. We compared the migratory staging of brent geese on saltmarsh and pasture sites in spring. Food quality (nitrogen and fibre content), antagonistic behaviour, and body weight were quantified at nearby sites in simultaneous seasons. Individuals were tracked with high-resolution GPS and accelerometers to compare timing of migration and time budgets during fuelling.
3. On pastures, birds rested more and experienced higher ingestion rates, similar or superior food quality and reduced antagonistic interactions than on saltmarsh.
4. Brent geese using fertilized grasslands advanced their fuelling and migration schedules compared to those using saltmarsh. Pasture birds reached heavy weights earlier, departed sooner, and arrived in the Arctic earlier.
5. Intertidal mudflats were frequently visited by saltmarsh birds during the day, and available food there (algae, some seagrass) was of higher quality than terrestrial resources. Availability of intertidal resources was an important factor balancing the otherwise more favourable conditions on pastures relative to saltmarsh.
6. Synthesis and applications. Disadvantages of longer foraging effort, more antagonistic interactions and delayed fuelling schedules on traditional saltmarshes may cause geese to exchange this traditional niche in favour of pastures, especially in a warming climate that requires advancement of migratory schedules. However, due to its high quality, intertidal forage can complement terrestrial foraging, potentially removing the incentive for habitat switches to pastures. The relatively high quality of green algae and seagrass, and birds' remarkable preference for these resources when available, provides a key for managers to create landscapes that can sustain this specialist's intertidal lifestyle. To keep natural habitats attractive to staging geese with the purpose of preventing conflicts with farming practices, management actions should focus on conservation and restoration of saltmarsh and especially intertidal habitat.","Dokter, Adriaan M.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Although the biomechanics of animal flight have been well studied in laboratory apparatus such as wind tunnels for many years, the applicability of these data to natural flight behaviour has been examined in few instances and mostly in the context of long-distance migration. Here, we used rotational stereo-videography to record the free-flight trajectories of foraging common swifts. We found that, despite their exquisite manoeuvring capabilities, the swifts only rarely performed high-acceleration turns. More surprisingly, we also found that despite feeding on tiny insects probably moving with ambient flow, the birds adjust their air speed to optimize cost of transport over distance. Finally, swifts spent only 25% of their time flapping; the majority of their time (71%) was spent in extended wing gliding, during which the average power expended for changes in speed or elevation was 0.84 W kg(-1) and not significantly different from 0. Thus, gliding swifts extracted sufficient environmental energy to pay the cost of flight during foraging.","Hedrick, Tyson L.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Many species of marine mammals have evolved behavioural adaptations to minimize heat loss to the surrounding water. We tracked 21 dugongs (Dugong dugon Muller 1776) using acoustic and satellite/GPS transmitters in 2012, 2013 and 2014 in Moreton Bay, Queensland at the high latitude limit of the species' winter range in eastern Australia to examine if there was a relationship between movements and environmental temperature that might suggest behavioural thermoregulation. Oceanic waters immediately outside the bay where the dugong's seagrass food is unavailable exhibited temperatures from 5.5 degrees C warmer to 3 degrees C cooler than the Eastern Banks, the major dugong habitat in the bay. All tracked dugongs made at least one (and up to 66) return trip(s) from the Eastern Banks to the adjacent oceanic waters. The probability of making an outgoing trip was highest in 2014 and lowest in 2013 when the water temperature inside the bay was higher than the other two years. The odds of making an outgoing trip were lower when temperature differences (outside minus inside) were small or negative but increased by a factor of up to 2.12 for each 1 degrees C positive difference. Individual dugongs were most likely to travel out of the bay between midnight and noon on an outgoing tide or at slack high water and return to the bay on an incoming tide or slack low water between noon and midnight. The amount of time a dugong spent outside the bay on each trip was relatively short with an overall median of 5.9 h. The dugongs' individual activity spaces generally declined as winter progressed suggesting a change in the cost-effectiveness of moving outside the bay. Our analysis adds to the evidence that dugongs undertake behavioural thermoregulation at least at the high latitude limits of their range.","Zeh, Daniel R.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Lake sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens populations show a variety of movement patterns that are poorly understood. To compare two migratory phenotypes of A. fulvescens in the St. Clair River, MI, USA, multiple data types were analysed. Individual fish were classified into migratory phenotypes based on acoustic telemetry data collected 2012-2015. Acipenser fulvescens consistently showed movement from the St. Clair River upriver into Lake Huron or downriver into Lake St. Clair. The two migratory phenotypes were then compared for differences in morphometrics, genetics and epigenetics. Morphological differences based on linear measurements were not detected between phenotypes. Microsatellite data from 11 loci suggested one population with no genetic differentiation between migratory phenotypes. Our epigenetic results indicated that the migratory phenotypes are differentially methylated (P < 0.05), thus epigenetics may be associated with migratory differences in A. fulvescens. Only one restriction site was identified to be driving the differential methylation (P < 0.05). While little evidence at neutral loci occurred for genetic differentiation of A. fulvescens, DNA methylation may play a role in the observed movement pattern variation. When combined with microsatellite and morphometric analyses, our results suggested that different migratory patterns may reflect phenotypic plasticity, allowing A. fulvescens to acclimate to short-term environmental variability. Without an integrated approach, the role of epigenetics in the migratory phenotype of A. fulvescens may have been overlooked. Further characterization of migratory phenotypes could be important for management to conserve behavioural variation across the distribution of A. fulvescens and for design of stocking guidelines.","Whitaker, Justine M.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Vultures are thought to form networks in the sky, with individuals monitoring the movements of others to gain up-to-date information on resource availability. While it is recognized that social information facilitates the search for carrion, how this facilitates the search for updrafts, another critical resource, remains unknown. In theory, birds could use information on updraft availability to modulate their flight speed, increasing their airspeed when informed on updraft location. In addition, the stylized circling behaviour associated with thermal soaring is likely to provide social cues on updraft availability for any bird operating in the surrounding area. We equipped five Gyps vultures with GPS and airspeed loggers to quantify the movements of birds flying in the same airspace. Birds that were socially informed on updraft availability immediately adopted higher airspeeds on entering the inter-thermal glide; a strategy that would be risky if birds were relying on personal information alone. This was embedded within a broader pattern of a reduction in airspeed (approx. 3 m s(-1)) through the glide, likely reflecting the need for low speed to sense and turn into the next thermal. Overall, this demonstrates (i) the complexity of factors affecting speed selection over fine temporal scales and (ii) that Gyps vultures respond to social information on the occurrence of energy in the aerial environment, which may reduce uncertainty in their movement decisions.","Williams, Hannah J.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Different methods to measure species behaviour and space use may produce diverging results, and provide advantages and shortcomings. Data from spot-mapping of animals might be affected from restricted detectability of individuals in dense vegetation, while radio-tracking provides a less biased (or even unbiased) measure of space use. Here we compare results from spot-mapping and telemetry of four family groups (i.e. five individuals belonging to these four family groups), respectively of the Kenyan endemic cooperative-breeding bird Hinde's babbler, Turdoides hindei. Data from spot-mapping showed that the space use of T. hindei is mostly restricted to riparian vegetation. Home-range sizes calculated from telemetry were five times larger if compared with data obtained from spot-mapping. Telemetry data showed that T hindei also moves across agricultural land, and mean and maximum displacements are larger if compared with data obtained from spot-mapping. Several reasons might lead to these differences: (1) Telemetry data also consider rare long-distance excursions, while (2) observers of spot-mapping might fail to observe long-distance movements and thus underestimate home-range sizes as well as displacement distances; (3) results from telemetry might become blurred from measurement error during the triangulation of fixes. Our study confirms that both methods provide advantages, but also shortcomings, which need to be considered when selecting a method to elaborate a research question.","Fischer, Christina

"savedrecs (30).txt","Habitat selection is a complex hierarchical process and in ungulates typically varies at broad spatial and temporal scales and among individuals. Recent advancements in the ability of global positioning system (GPS)-collars to collect activity data provide opportunities to understand underlying mechanisms or trade-offs responsible for fine-scale variation in habitat selection. Based on data from 64 female black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus columbianus) fitted with GPS-collars in northern California, USA, between 2004 and 2013, we first investigated habitat selection at the home range scale. We then used data from a subset of 27 individuals to determine if habitat selection within home ranges was influenced by activity states (active or inactive). Habitat selection by black-tailed deer varied between summer and winter and was mostly explained by differences in elevation, terrain, and vegetation. Within their home ranges, black-tailed deer showed fine-scale selection for habitats that varied with activity states. In summer, selection for edge density and forest types varied across activity states highlighting important fine-scale selection patterns. Activity state also affected our conclusions about the selection of habitats including slope, canopy cover, and forest types by black-tailed deer in winter. During both seasons, deer selected for apparently secure habitat when inactive, likely to minimize risk of predation. These results highlight the importance of considering activity states when evaluating habitat selection from animal location data. This is particularly important in multi-use landscapes such as national forests where habitat needs of ungulates are important considerations in management decisions, including timber harvest.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Survival and habitat selection during brood-rearing influences reproductive success and waterfowl population dynamics. For effective management, it is important to understand vital rates and habitat choice range wide. We investigated survival and habitat selection of female wood ducks (Aix sponsa) and ducklings at Long Point, Lake Erie, Ontario, Canada in 2014. We captured incubating females (n=40) in nest boxes and used radio-telemetry to monitor survival and habitat use to 30 days post-hatch. Four female mortalities occurred during brood-rearing and apparent brood and duckling survival were 0.42 (85% CI=0.33, 0.51) and 0.16 (85% CI=0.14, 0.18), respectively. Duckling survival was negatively associated with brood size and distance of first movement, whereas survival was positively associated with precipitation. Successful brood-rearing wood ducks selected forested wetlands and habitats that provided dense vegetative cover. Conservation and restoration of forested wetlands and similar cover should increase the availability of brood-rearing habitat. Placement of nest boxes close to selected land cover types and strategies associated with reducing inflated clutch sizes may improve offspring survival. Our spatially explicit habitat selection model informs spatial prioritization of habitat conservation and nest box placement strategies within the Great Lakes region.

"savedrecs (30).txt","The most direct effects of wind energy development on birds are rotor blade strikes and collisions with wind turbines. Probability of a blade strike is affected by the rates at which a bird visits the rotor swept zone (RSZ), and mitigated by the behaviors it uses to avoid being struck. Between 2011 and 2013, we studied the occurrence and nature of avoidance responses of 3 nesting ferruginous hawks (Buteo regalis), 5 Swainson's hawks (B. swainsoni), and 2 red-tailed hawks (B. jamaicensis) to turbines built within their territories. Two of 10 breeding males we tracked with satellite telemetry were turbine-collision fatalities, one during the study and the other in the following year. Collectively, nesting hawks displayed no macro-avoidance of turbine projects and flew adjacent to or within RSZs at high rates ((x) over bar = 0.8 visits/hr, 1.3 min/visit; n = 387 visits during 434 hr of observation) synchronized with morning and afternoon peaks in foraging activity. Passes through rotors accounted for 9.8% of responses. The turbine that hawks approached most closely from collective encounters on each territory accounted for an average of 29% of all visits to RSZs and visitation was greater than expected at turbines <0.8 km from nests (P < 0.001). As rotor speed increased, the frequency that hawks in RSZs flew between turbine rows increased relative to other avoidance behaviors and hawks that were potentially distracted (i.e., hunting or aggressive chasing) increased avoidance flights over and between turbines. The ability of hawks to employ evasive behaviors mitigated blade collision but allowed for close, hourly interaction with turbines that increased risk of collision. Where nesting populations of hawks are at risk, particularly ferruginous hawks, pre-construction siting of wind turbines needs to account for nest locations and expected high rates of hawk visitation to turbines <800 m from nests. On existing projects collision risk can be reduced through operational shutdown of turbines in this zone during 2 daily peaks in hawk foraging in the vicinity where hawks nest, but a greater effectiveness can be achieved by shutdown of specific turbines associated with highest regular use.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Unidirectional drift is amongst the most relevant population regulators in riverine animal populations. Drift occurs randomly, but it can also be a behavioural response to abiotic and biotic stressors, or the result of catastrophic events such as heavy rain. In this study, we investigate the spatiotemporal distribution of larvae of the fire salamander (Salamandra salamandra) in three headwater streams in the Eifel mountains, Western Germany. We marked 568 salamander larvae to conduct capture-recapture estimates of abundance, and followed their individual fate throughout the season. Population density of larval salamanders along the stream showed both strong temporal and spatial variation. Random drift of salamander larvae was particularly rare, and drift did not result in a size structuring of larval populations in the field. Yet, catastrophic events of high summer precipitation were the best predictor for pulse-wise restructuring of the salamander larvae's density distribution. Strong discharge coincided with a severe decrease in population density, and thus appears to be the most relevant cause of mortality for salamander larvae. Furthermore, we find strong indications that drift has the potential to influence this species' evolutionary processes, as well as its ecological prevalence.","Reinhardt, T.

"savedrecs (30).txt","ContextAlthough animal movement behaviors are influenced by spatial heterogeneity, such behaviors can also generate spatial heterogeneity via interactions with the emergent spatial structure and other individuals (i.e., the social landscape).ObjectiveElucidate the behavioral and ecological mechanisms of pattern formation in a homogeneous resource landscape.MethodsWe analyzed the movement pathways and space-use patterns of the lesser grain borer (Rhyzopertha dominica) within homogeneous resource landscapes (wheat kernels). Experimental trials consisted of individual beetles foraging alone or paired with a member of the same or different sex.ResultsWe identified two sources of pattern formation: (1) beetles were attracted to areas where they or another beetle had previously fed, leading to increased patchiness via positive reinforcement; and (2) the presence of conspecifics affected whether and at what scales patchiness occurred. Solitary males had lower rates of movement and less tortuous pathways than solitary females, but both sexes generated fine-scale patchiness in the resource distribution. Patchy resource landscapes were also generated by male-female pairs, but not by same-sex pairings. Paired females in particular exhibited significantly greater daily net displacements and more random space use than solitary females.ConclusionsPattern formation is a complex process, even in a relatively simple, homogeneous resource landscape. In particular, patterns created by individuals when foraging alone versus in pairs underscores how social interactions can fundamentally alter the resultant pattern of heterogeneity that emerges in resource landscapes.","Cordeiro, Erick M.

Wolves engaged in extraterritorial forays almost exclusively during fall and winter, when they occurred on average every 22 days, for relatively brief periods (i.e., <= 4 days) and short distances (i.e., mean minimum travelled distance of 13.3 +/- 7.2 SD km). Three extraterritorial forays were later revealed to be pre-dispersal movements, featuring longer duration and higher travelled distances than other extraterritorial forays and occurring 33-17 days prior to dispersal. We also anecdotally report two cases of dispersal, one involving an adult female that travelled 41.2 km to establish a new territory adjacent to her natal home range, and the other involving a yearling male that travelled a minimum of 422.2 km to the adjacent Majella National Park.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Little is known about the movement ecology of male South American fur seals (SAFS; Arctocephalus australis). To begin to address knowledge gaps we used satellite telemetry to track four adult male SAFS at the Falkland Islands over the non-breeding period, from May to December. Our aims were to describe adult male SAFS habitat use and quantify spatial overlap between male SAFS and commercial trawl fisheries. Foraging trip duration ranged from an individual mean of 8.6 +/- 6.7 days to 39.2 +/- 9.7 days. Adult males typically behaved like central place foragers and foraging trips were restricted to the Patagonian Shelf and shelf slope (mean distance 251 +/- 239 km). However, some males ventured as far as 990 km to the north of the Falkland Islands. Overall, male SAFS spent 64% of their time in areas of trawl fishing activity, with the majority of overlap occurring within the Argentinean Exclusive Economic Zone (56%) and the Falkland Islands Exclusive Economic Zone (43%). Although overlap does not necessarily equate to interaction, the extent to which SAFS and fisheries interact is currently poorly understood. The emerging picture from our study is that SAFS and fisheries overlap and potentially interact across large spatial scales and multiple fishery jurisdictions.

Taking advantage of GPS collars with activity sensors collecting a large amount of data per hour, we separately studied diurnal and nocturnal activity patterns of Alpine chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra), in order to identify the factors affecting them and the correlation between them. From March 2010 to November 2013, we collected data on 17 chamois in the Swiss National Park, a strict Alpine nature reserve where human management was forbidden and human harassment quite rare. Environmental factors were found to significantly influence both diurnal and nocturnal activity rhythms, with temperature and seasonality playing a pivotal role. Surprisingly, we detected a stable peak of activity in the first part of the night, which varied only slightly over the year. In summer, the nocturnal activity of males was inversely correlated to diurnal activity, arguably to compensate for scarce diurnal food intake. Conversely, winter nocturnal activity was positively related to the diurnal activity and served as a cumulative opportunity for energy intake. Chamois showed a weak lunarphilia, with a slight increase in activity levels during moonlit nights, especially during the mating season. In conclusion, our findings denote chamois as a cathemeral species able to adapt its behavioural patterns to match varying environmental conditions. (C) 2018 Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Saugetierkunde.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Wildlife populations occurring at the edge of their range boundaries are thought to be the most sensitive to climate change due to temperatures being at or near the limit of a species' thermal envelope. Moose (Alces americanus) are a cold adapted species that are showing population declines in some portions of the southern edge of their range. However, other moose populations are actively expanding southward into thermally stressful areas. The direct effects of temperature on moose have not yet been studied in these southwardly expanding populations and may offer insights into how moose are successfully establishing in areas at the edge of their thermal envelope. We used ambient temperature and GPS collar data from moose to quantify the direct effect of temperature on moose habitat use in Massachusetts, USA, which is one of these southwardly expanding populations. The mean daily temperature in our study area exceeded the reported physiological tolerances of moose in over 90% of daytime and 75% of nighttime locations in summer and in over 80% of daytime and 67% of nighttime locations in winter. Across seasons and times of day, moose preferred regenerating forest, but as ambient air temperatures increased, selection for regenerating forest declined and selection for forested wetlands and coniferous forest increased. This response indicates moose are altering their behavior to utilize thermal shelters when temperatures are high. We observed higher temperatures and stronger behavioral responses than other studies at the southern edge of moose range. We found habitat for moose in Massachusetts is climatically marginal and loss of habitat, increase in parasites, and further climatic warming may cause population declines in the future.

"savedrecs (30).txt","The development of multisensor animal-attached tags, recording data at high frequencies, has enormous potential in allowing us to define animal behaviour. The high volumes of data, are pushing us towards machine-learning as a powerful option for distilling out behaviours. However, with increasing parallel lines of data, systems become more likely to become processor limited and thereby take appreciable amounts of time to resolve behaviours. We suggest a Boolean approach whereby critical changes in recorded parameters are used as sequential templates with defined flexibility (in both time and degree) to determine individual behavioural elements within a behavioural sequence that, together, makes up a single, defined behaviour. We tested this approach, and compared it to a suite of other behavioural identification methods, on a number of behaviours from tag-equipped animals; sheep grazing, penguins walking, cheetah stalking prey and condors thermalling. Overall behaviour recognition using our new approach was better than most other methods due to; (1) its ability to deal with behavioural variation and (2) the speed with which the task was completed because extraneous data are avoided in the process. We suggest that this approach is a promising way forward in an increasingly data-rich environment and that workers sharing algorithms can provide a powerful library for the benefit of all involved in such work.","Wilson, Rory P.

In this model, the maximum density of crowd can reach to 8 person/m(2) which is measured by the experiment. And pedestrians can move to 14 directions if there are no obstructions around them. Meanwhile, this paper proposes the concept and calculation rules of moving potential in the moving field. The moving potential provides reference for the movement of a pedestrian. Through the comparison of the measured values and the simulated values of an evacuation process in a building, it is proved that the model can accurately simulate the evacuation process of high density crowd.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Modeling the complex collective behavior is a challenging issue in several material and life sciences. The collective motion has been usually modeled by simple interaction rules and explained by global statistics. However, it remains difficult to bridge the gap between the dynamic properties of the complex interaction and the emerging group-level functions. Here we introduce decomposition methods to directly extract and classify the latent global dynamics of nonlinear dynamical systems in an equation-free manner, even including complex interaction in few data dimensions. We first verified that the basic decomposition method can extract and discriminate the dynamics of a well-known rule-based fish-schooling (or bird-flocking) model. The method extracted different temporal frequency modes with spatial interaction coherence among three distinct emergent motions, whereas these wave properties in multiple spatiotemporal scales showed similar dispersion relations. Second, we extended the basic method to map high-dimensional feature space for application to actual small-dimensional systems complexly changing the interaction rules. Using group sports human data, we classified the dynamics and predicted the group objective achievement. Our methods have a potential for classifying collective motions in various domains which obey in non-trivial dominance law known as active matters.","Fujii, Keisuke

"savedrecs (30).txt","Comparative studies of subspecies under different ecological environments offer insights into intraspecies evolutionary adaptive mechanisms. Golden snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus roxellana) include three subspecies in China classified mainly by their morphological variations: R.r. roxellana (Sichuan and Gansu province), R.r. qinlingensis (Shaanxi province) and R.r. hubeiensis (Hubei province). These three subspecies live in three isolated area with different environments. Past works focused on the last two subspecies, but little information of habitat and behaviors of the nominated subspecies (R.r. roxellana) is available to date. We conducted a two-year study on the diet, activity budget, home range and social organization of 4 herds of R.r. roxellana, based on a total of 106 days' observation in Laohegou (LHG) Nature Reserve, Sichuan province. By using scan sampling method, our results suggest that the R.r roxellana feeds predominantly on leaves (77.5%), and spends more time feeding (40.0%) and resting (27.0%) while compared to the other two subspecies. Kernel Density Estimation Method based on GPS technology confirms that R.r roxellana has relatively larger home ranges (49.1 km(2)). The unit size (8.3 +/- 3.5 individuals) of R.r roxellana is also smaller. Therefore, it is possible that differences in food availability in relation to habitats have important impacts on the feeding strategy and social system of the golden snub-nosed monkey. These results provide data to further explore intraspecific adaptations of living primates.","Fang, Gu

"savedrecs (30).txt","Recently, modern smartphones equipped with a variety of embedded-sensors, such as accelerometers and gyroscopes, have been used as an alternative platform for human activity recognition (HAR), since they are cost-effective, unobtrusive and they facilitate real-time applications. However, the majority of the related works have proposed a position-dependent HAR, i.e., the target subject has to fix the smartphone in a pre-defined position. Few studies have tackled the problem of position-independent HAR. They have tackled the problem either using handcrafted features that are less influenced by the position of the smartphone or by building a position-aware HAR. The performance of these studies still needs more improvement to produce a reliable smartphone-based HAR. Thus, in this paper, we propose a deep convolution neural network model that provides a robust position-independent HAR system. We build and evaluate the performance of the proposed model using the RealWorld HAR public dataset. We find that our deep learning proposed model increases the overall performance compared to the state-of-the-art traditional machine learning method from 84% to 88% for position-independent HAR. In addition, the position detection performance of our model improves superiorly from 89% to 98%. Finally, the recognition time of the proposed model is evaluated in order to validate the applicability of the model for real-time applications.","Almaslukh, Bandar

"savedrecs (30).txt","There are multiple methods for tracking individuals, but the classical ones such as using GPS or video surveillance systems do not scale or have large costs. The need for large-scale tracking, for thousands or even millions of individuals, over large areas such as cities, requires the use of alternative techniques. WiFi tracking is a scalable solution that has gained attention recently. This method permits unobtrusive tracking of large crowds, at a reduced cost. However, extracting knowledge from the data gathered through WiFi tracking is not simple, due to the low positional accuracy and the dependence on signals generated by the tracked device, which are irregular and sparse. To facilitate further data analysis, we can partition individual trajectories into periods of stops and moves. This abstraction level is fundamental, and it opens the way for answering complex questions about visited locations or even social behavior. Determining stops and movements has been previously addressed for tracking data gathered using GPS. GPS trajectories have higher positional accuracy at a fixed, higher frequency as compared to trajectories obtained through WiFi. However, even with the increase in accuracy, the problem, of separating traces in periods of stops and movements, remains similar to the one we encountered for WiFi tracking. In this paper, we study three algorithms for determining stops and movements for GPS-based datasets and explore their applicability to WiFi-based data. We propose possible improvements to the best-performing algorithm considering the specifics of WiFi tracking data.","Chilipirea, Cristian

"savedrecs (30).txt","Sedentary Behavior (SB) is among the most frequent human behaviors and is associated with a plethora of serious chronic lifestyle diseases as well as premature death. Office workers in particular are at an increased risk due to their extensive amounts of occupational SB. However, we still lack an objective method to measure SB consistent with its definition. We have therefore developed a new measurement system based on muscular activity and accelerometry. The primary aim of the present study was to calibrate the new-developed 8-CH-EMG+ for measuring occupational SB against an indirect calorimeter during typical desk-based office work activities. In total, 25 volunteers performed nine office tasks at three typical workplaces. Minute-by-minute posture and activity classification was performed using subsequent decision trees developed with artificial intelligence data processing techniques. The 8-CH-EMG+ successfully identified all sitting episodes (AUC = 1.0). Furthermore, depending on the number of electromyography channels included, the device has a sensitivity of 83-98% and 74-98% to detect SB and active sitting (AUC = 0.85-0.91). The 8-CH-EMG+ advances the field of objective SB measurements by combining accelerometry with muscular activity. Future field studies should consider the use of EMG sensors to record SB in line with its definition.","Kuster, Roman P.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Human being detection via ultra-wideband (UWB) radars has shown great prospects in many areas, such as biomedicine, military operation, public security, emergency rescue, and so on. When a person stays stationary, the main feature that separates him/her from surroundings is the movement of chest wall due to breath. There have been many algorithms developed for breath detection while using UWB radars. However, those algorithms were almost based on a basic scheme that focused on processing in the time dimension of UWB data. They did not utilize the benefits from the wide operational bandwidth of UWB radars to show potential superiority over those narrowband systems such as a continuous wave (CW) Doppler radar. In this paper, a breath detection method was proposed based on operational bandwidth segmentation. A basic theoretical model was firstly introduced, indicating that characteristics of breath signals contained in UWB echoes were consistent among the operational frequencies, while those of clutters were not. So, the method divided a set of UWB echo data into a number of subsets, each of which corresponded to a sub-band within the operational bandwidth of the UWB radar. Thus information about the operational frequency is provided for subsequent processing. With the aid of the information, a breath enhancement algorithm was developed mainly by averaging the segmented UWB data along the operational frequency. The algorithm's performance was verified by data measured by a stepped-frequency CW (SFCW) UWB radar. The experimental results showed that the algorithm performed better than that without the segmentation. They also showed its feasibility for fast detection of breath based on a short duration of data. Moreover, the method's potential for target identification and impulse-radio (IR) UWB radar was investigated. In summary, the method provides a new processing scheme for UWB radars when they are used for breath detection. With this scheme, the UWB radars have a benefit of greater flexibility in data processing over those narrowband radars, and thus will perform more effectively and efficiently in practical applications.","Lv, Hao

"savedrecs (30).txt","Attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder, which is characterized by inattention, hyperactivity and impulsive behaviors. In particular, children have difficulty keeping still exhibiting increased fine and gross motor activity. This paper focuses on analyzing the data obtained from two tri-axial accelerometers (one on the wrist of the dominant arm and the other on the ankle of the dominant leg) worn during school hours by a group of 22 children (11 children with ADHD and 11 paired controls). Five of the 11 ADHD diagnosed children were not on medication during the study. The children were not explicitly instructed to perform any particular activity but followed a normal session at school alternating classes of little or moderate physical activity with intermediate breaks of more prominent physical activity. The tri-axial acceleration signals were converted into 2D acceleration images and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was trained to recognize the differences between non-medicated ADHD children and their paired controls. The results show that there were statistically significant differences in the way the two groups moved for the wrist accelerometer (t-test p-value <0.05). For the ankle accelerometer statistical significance was only achieved between data from the non-medicated children in the experimental group and the control group. Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to automatically extract embedded acceleration patterns and provide an objective measure to help in the diagnosis of ADHD, an accuracy of 0.875 for the wrist sensor and an accuracy of 0.9375 for the ankle sensor was achieved.","Munoz-Organero, Mario

"savedrecs (30).txt","Animal research has always played a crucial role in various medical and scientific breakthroughs. They offer, inter alia, insights into diseases mechanisms, genetic predisposition to a disease, and drug therapy. However, the use of animals for medical research is a cause of major controversies and debates in modern science. To warrant high bioethical standards, new directives have been being adopted to replace animal research whenever possible, to reduce the number of animals, and to refine the procedures to minimize stress and pain. Here, we present two new approaches, based on thermal imaging (a remote and passive technology), to assess respiratory rate (RR) as well as exploratory behavior and general activity in rodents. In animal research, these parameters are gold standards for welfare assessment. The approaches were validated in a study conducted with both rats and mice. To test the feasibility of our algorithm to estimate RR, thermal videos from anesthetized rodents were acquired. The capability of the second approach to monitor activity was tested with videos of Open Field tests. Regarding RR, a high agreement between thermal imaging and gold standard (electrocardiography-derived RR) was achieved. The mean relative error averaged 0.50 +/- 0.15 breaths/min and 4.55 +/- 2.94 breaths/min for rats and mice, respectively. The second approach was capable of monitoring and tracking the activity of the rodents very well. This paper demonstrates that thermal imaging is a promising and relevant alternative for monitoring of RR and activity in rodents, thus contributing to the remote assessment of animal welfare.","Pereira, Carina Barbosa

"savedrecs (30).txt","GPS trajectories generated by moving objects provide researchers with an excellent resource for revealing patterns of human activities. Relevant research based on GPS trajectories includes the fields of location-based services, transportation science, and urban studies among others. Research relating to how to obtain GPS data (e.g., GPS data acquisition, GPS data processing) is receiving significant attention because of the availability of GPS data collecting platforms. One such problem is the GPS data classification based on transportation mode. The challenge of classifying trajectories by transportation mode has approached detecting different modes of movement through the application of several strategies. From a GPS data acquisition point of view, this paper macroscopically classifies the transportation mode of GPS data into single-mode and mixed-mode. That means GPS trajectories collected based on one type of transportation mode are regarded as single-mode data; otherwise it is considered as mixed-mode data. The one big difference of classification strategy between single-mode and mixed-mode GPS data is whether we need to recognize the transition points or activity episodes first. Based on this, we systematically review existing classification methods for single-mode and mixed-mode GPS data and introduce the contributions of these methods as well as discuss their unresolved issues to provide directions for future studies in this field. Based on this review and the transportation application at hand, researchers can select the most appropriate method and endeavor to improve them.","Yang, Xue

"savedrecs (30).txt","Dams and turbines associated with hydroelectric power plants (HEP) disrupt connectivity by affecting fish movement and survival. There has been an increasing focus on measures to facilitate downstream migration at HEPs. The fish guidance efficacy (FGE) of downstream mitigation measures largely remains suboptimal and calls for development of knowledge on factors influencing FGE. In this study, we analyse 6 years of wild Atlantic salmon smolt passive integrated transponder (PIT)-telemetry data (N = 1,498) from a neighbouring small- and a large-scale HEP. Timing of the smolt migration period was significantly different between the two rivers. Thus, river-specific smolt-run timing is imperative for proper measures management in regulated rivers aiming at maximizing smolt-descent survival. A generalized linear model including additive effects of relative bypass discharge and scaled river discharge on the FGE for descending smolts received highest Akaike's information criterion support in the data and explained 74.2% of the FGE variation. This model, including no river effect, predicted high FGE (up to 90%) at low river flow (<= 30% of HEP maximum capacity) when 7% of the water is allocated through the bypass. Many run-of-the-river HEPs have highly variable river flow during the smolt-run period. Our model suggests that these HEPs could utilize their manoeuvre flexibility to obtain water allocation routines between bypass and turbines that optimize both FGE and hydroelectric production.","Haraldstad, Tormod

"savedrecs (30).txt","Failure to account for time-varying detection ranges when inferring space use of marine species from passive acoustic telemetry data can bias estimates and result in erroneous biological conclusions. This potential source of bias is widely acknowledged but often ignored in practice due to a lack of available statistical methods. Here, we describe and apply a spatial point process model for estimating individual centres of activity (COAs) from acoustic telemetry data that can be modified to account for both receiver- and time-specific detection probabilities. We use simulation testing to evaluate the suitability of the proposed models for estimating COAs and compare their performance to that of the popular mean-weighted COA method for a variety of scenarios. We illustrate how the approach can be applied to correct for variable detection ranges by integrating data from moored test tags and demonstrate how accounting for time-varying detection probabilities can impact space use estimates by fitting the model to data collected from a black sea bass (Centropristis striata) on a receiver array off the east coast of the United States. The proposed model reduced bias in COA estimates, particularly when tagged individuals occurred along the periphery of the receiver array. The test tag-integrated model largely corrected the bias associated with receiver- and time-specific detection probabilities. When applied to the black sea bass detection data, the model revealed fine-scale movements not apparent when detection ranges were assumed constant. Spatial management practices for coastal marine species are often based on trends in space use inferred from passive acoustic telemetry data, which can be misinterpreted when factors influencing detection ranges are not accounted for. Our approach provides a general framework for estimating individual COAs that can be modified on a study-specific basis to ensure resulting patterns of space use reflect a species' movements and behaviour, rather than variation in receiver detection ranges.","Winton, Megan V.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Understanding the fine-scale movements and habitat use patterns of marine predators is critical for identifying important foraging habitat and guiding effective conservation planning. Here, GPS loggers were used to track chick-rearing Cassin's auklets (Ptychoramphus aleuticus) at their largest breeding colony, located on Triangle Island, British Columbia, Canada (50 degrees 5135N; 129 degrees 434W). Analyses were conducted at both the individual and population level to assess whether inter-annual variation in habitat use (2014, 2015, and 2017) could be explained by dynamic oceanographic features, such as sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll a concentrations, or by static bathymetric features. At both scales of analyses, the foraging behaviour of Cassin's auklets was most strongly influenced by SST. At the individual level, birds spent more time foraging in areas with lower SST, relative to other areas visited over the course of a foraging trip. At the population level, the at-sea distribution of Cassin's auklets varied across years, with birds using areas northwest of colony in 2014 and areas west of the colony in 2015 and 2017. Furthermore, the probability of foraging across the study area was higher in areas with lower SST, suggesting that SST influences the broad-scale foraging distribution of Cassin's auklets. Identification of the environmental drivers of habitat use across multiple years can be used to help in predicting suitable at-sea habitat across time, leading to more effective conservation management.","Domalik, Alice D.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Differentiating detections of a telemetered fish from those of predators that may have consumed that telemetered fish presents problems and opportunities. Previous efforts to classify predation events quantitatively have had to rely on data from unknown states of fish (i.e., unsupervised learning techniques) with the consequence that model performance cannot be refined or compared with alternate models. We circumvent this limitation by analysing acoustic telemetry track data to differentiate movement patterns of tagged striped bass (Morone saxitilis) from those of Atlantic salmon (Salmo solar) smolts, which were known to not have been predated by striped bass over a 3-year period in the Miramichi River estuary. A random forests classification model (i.e., supervised learning technique) was used to differentiate the movement patterns of these two species and the model was applied to Atlantic salmon smolt movement characteristics to provide an index of striped bass predation-derived mortality. The optimized random forests model inferred that predation rates by striped bass were highly variable between years for two smolt stocks, ranging from 1.9% to 17.5%. Spatial and temporal overlap of the two species is a likely factor defining the between stock and annual variation of predation rate estimates.","Daniels, Jason

"savedrecs (30).txt","Large predatory fishes, capable of traveling great distances, can facilitate energy flow linkages among spatially separated habitat patches via extended foraging behaviors over expansive areas. Here, we tested this concept by tracking the movement of a large mobile estuarine fish, red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus). Specifically, we addressed the following two questions: (i) What are the spatial and temporal patterns of red drum movement (rates of dispersal) and activity space? (ii) Does red drum movement facilitate linkages among estuarine marsh complexes? Dispersal from the release location was greatest during the first 2 weeks at liberty before declining to less than 0.5 km.week(-1) for the remainder of the study. Activity space initially increased rapidly before reaching an asymptote at 2.5 km(2) 2 weeks postrelease. Connectivity indices calculated among marsh complexes corroborated these observations, suggesting high residency and limited seascape-scale linkages via red drum movement behaviors. These data highlight potential within-estuary spatial structure for mobile fishes and could inform subsequent efforts to track energy flows in coastal food webs, predict the footprint of local habitat restoration benefits, and enhance the design of survey regimes to quantify overall population demography.","Kenworthy, Matthew D.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) inhabiting Prince William Sound (PWS) may constitute a localized population separate from Gulf of Alaska (GOA) populations; however, connectivity between these regions has not been previously explored. To address this knowledge gap, we investigated Pacific cod migratory behavior and site fidelity using passive acoustic telemetry techniques. Acoustic-tagged Pacific cod (n = 111) were monitored by Ocean Tracking Network acoustic arrays located at the straits and passages connecting PWS with the GOA and arrays deployed in two PWS fjords. Few Pacific cod tagged in PWS moved to the PWS-GOA boundary (1.8%), indicating that demographic connectivity with the GOA was low. Furthermore, 77% of tagged cod spent at least 90% of the time they were known to be alive within small (less than 30 km(2)) fjords. Cod were present at monitored fjords every month of the study, though some cod migrated away from the fjords during the summer and returned the following winter (11% in 2015 and 5% in 2016). Using continuous-time multistate Markov models, we determined that movement behavior was related to fish length. Larger fish tended to emigrate from monitored fjords more often and undergo longer duration migrations.","Lewandoski, Sean A.

"savedrecs (30).txt","The rusty blackbird (Euphagus carolinus) is a species of conservation concern throughout its range because of rapid population decline. During winter, relatively large flocks are in suburban landscapes within the Georgia and South Carolina Piedmont Plateau of the southeastern United States. We studied radio-tagged blackbirds within flocks that moved daily among 3 distinct patch types: pecan (Carya illinoinensis) and small-seeded oak (Quercus spp.) groves, shallowly flooded forested wetlands, and residential areas landscaped with turf grass. The patch types used for foraging have varying availability of invertebrate and mast food. We investigated the relationship between daily observations of blackbird flocks and previous, current, and oncoming short-term weather. Suburban landscapes with the appropriate configuration of shallow wetland, residential lawns, and mast grove patches within a 153-415-ha area, the size of patch aggregations in this study, likely constitute high quality wintering areas for this species. Blackbird flocks were 1.6-1.8 times more likely to be observed foraging in wetlands with each 10 degrees C increase in current temperature, 1.5 times more likely in wetlands for every 5 days with no previous precipitation, and 3.2 times more likely in wetlands with every 10 extra hours of oncoming cold weather. Blackbirds were 4.1-4.5 times less likely to be observed foraging in forested wetlands with every 5-mm increase in current precipitation. Blackbirds were 2.2 times more likely to be observed in mast groves with every 5-mm of oncoming precipitation. Radio-tagged blackbirds used pecan groves for foraging in 2011 but not 2012, which was an overall warmer winter. Pecan groves may be a sporadically used component of a combination of foraging patches that are rarely near flooded forested wetlands or residential areas. Our results can be used to identify and conserve patch components used by rusty blackbird flocks during winter in suburban nature parks and greenways.

"savedrecs (30).txt","When hatchling freshwater turtles emerge from nests and first experience environmental stimuli, they primarily use visual cues to disperse toward nearby open horizons or far dark horizons. Within hours, hatchling Blanding's turtles (Emydoidea blandingii) develop compass mechanisms to maintain their headings when the initial dispersal targets become invisible. We captured hatchling Blanding's turtles during dispersal in natural habitat, attached a magnetic or non-magnet disk to each turtle, translocated them into an arena in a visually uniform field of corn, and measured their compass orientation (heading). Hatchlings from the magnet and no-magnet groups were evenly divided into two environmental chambers (6-h clock-shift or non-clock-shift) to create four experimental treatments. After 5 to 11days hatchlings were re-released in the arena. If hatchlings used a time-compensated sun compass, then clock-shifting would cause a similar to 90 degrees change in heading. If they used a geomagnetic compass, disruption of magnetoreception would cause wandering. If both compasses were used simultaneously or sequentially, we predicted a range of outcomes. All four treatment groups dispersed directionally during both trials, maintaining their prior headings in natural habitat except for the clock-shift treatment which changed heading similar to 90 degrees as predicted. The ability of hatchlings to maintain prior headings despite the disruption of geomagnetism supports the absence, inactivity, or disregard of a geomagnetic compass. Only a time-compensated sun compass coupled with an internal clock was necessary and sufficient for hatchlings to maintain compass headings during natal dispersal when relocated from natural prairie habitat to a monoculture habitat with a relatively uniform visual horizon.
Significance statement
Individuals moving long distances (e.g., migrating birds or dispersing salamanders) often maintain their movement headings using compass orientation (i.e., a geomagnetic or time-compensated sun compass). When hatchling freshwater turtles emerge from underground terrestrial nests they initiate dispersal in search of wetlands primarily based on visual horizon cues. Because such cues often become obscured by uneven terrain or dense vegetation and because straight-line travel is more efficient and less risky, hatchlings soon develop a mechanism of compass orientation to maintain their dispersal headings. We disrupted their ability to use magnetoreception by attaching magnets to their shells, manipulated their sense of time-of-day with clock-shifting, and then monitored their dispersal in a visually uniform field of mature corn. Our results demonstrated that a sun compass was necessary and sufficient for hatchlings with dispersal experience to maintain their dispersal headings when natural environmental cues were not visible.","Krenz, John D.

"savedrecs (30).txt","This study was carried out to provide information about movement and habitat use by an endemic Salmonid species (Salmo opimus Turan et al. Ichthyol Explor Freshw 23: 219-236, Turan et al. 2012) in Frnz Stream, a tributary of River Ceyhan in Turkey, using manual tracking as a radio telemetry technique. During the study, 19 of the 23 tagged trout were relocated by eight to 20 times (mean: 15 relocations per fish) in Frnz Stream. The time between the tracking surveys and relocations varied from 21 to 44days (mean: 30days) and the mean distance between relocations was 151m (26 to 881m). Tagged trout showed a distribution within a distance of 9350m in Frnz Stream. 95% of the relocations clustered at a distance of 4500m, while 75 and 50% of them were distributed at a distance of 1935m and 1488m, respectively. The linear home range of the individual ranged from 199 to 5087m (mean 792m), whereas mean 95% Kernel Density Home Range (KDHR), 75% KDHR, and mean core range (50% KDHR), were 632m, 477m and 290m, respectively. The depths and velocities of the locations where tagged trout occurred varied from 20 to 185cm (mean depth: 43cm) and 11 to 240cm/s (mean velocity: 45.9cm/s). There was no correlation between fish size and depth and fish size and velocity. Hydropower stations and trout farms negatively affected movement of the brown trout in the stream. The fish passage in Frnz Hydropower Station (HPP) is inefficient due to low water mark downstream. Thus, all the obstructions that prevent fish movements must be arranged to enable fish passage in Frnz Stream in order to preserve the brown trout population in the stream.","Alp, Ahmet

"savedrecs (30).txt","Understanding the spatio-temporal characteristics of animal movement is integral to effective conservation and management. Golden perch (Macquaria ambigua) is a potamodromous species known to undertake long-distance movements, putatively in response to elevated flow in spring and summer. In this study, 52 adult golden perch from the lower River Murray were surgically implanted with radio transmitters and passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags, and tracked for 2years. Strong site fidelity was common, with 19 fish (36%) remaining at the site of capture throughout the study. This included a spawning season (spring-summer) and a period of elevated flow. Eighteen fish (35%) made small- to medium-scale (2-22km) movements that included the establishment of new home sites. Fifteen fish (29%) migrated long distances (33-270km) upstream in spring-summer, coincident with steady, falling and rising flows. These movements were correlated with seasonal variation in mean daily water temperature, and to a lesser extent, short-term (10-day) flow variability, and did not coincide with spawning or recruitment during the year of migration. This contrasts previous studies that have associated long-distance movements of golden perch with increased flows and spawning. Upstream migration continued until passage was blocked by a weir, or fish were captured by anglers. Our results highlight the need for a broad spatio-temporal perspective when investigating the movement of long-lived potamodromous fishes, to integrate the range of behaviours exhibited by individuals and population contingents. We advocate that life history models that incorporate behavioural plasticity and a river-scale perspective will advance conservation.","Zampatti, Brenton P.

"savedrecs (30).txt","The grazing dynamics of animals differ depending on whether they are raised on rangeland or sward areas. Grazing patterns of cattle raised on rangeland can be modified by the location of supplement feed and water troughs. However, no information about the use of this strategy is available for swards. Thus, the effects of the location of supplementary feed and water troughs in small (7500m(2)) irrigated swards on movement, behavior and distribution were studied in a herd of 15 Brahman cows. The herd grazed on five swards in rotation, for seven days on each sward, so that each sward then had 28 days of rest. There were four rotations, giving four replicates of each of five treatments. For each rotation, one of the following treatments was randomly assigned to each sward. Supplementary feed and water troughs were: T1 in the same corner of the sward; T2 separate, each in the middle of one of the shorter sides of the sward; T3 separate in diagonally opposite corners; T4 separate in adjacent corners; T5 together in the sward center. The behavior and location of each cow was registered on a daily basis, every 2 h from 9:00 to 15:00 h, 7 days/week, using instantaneous scan sampling during the 140 days that the experiment lasted. Total distance traveled of each cow (i.e. the sum of Euclidean distances between the four subsequent positions of each cow within each day) was longer in T2 and T3 than in T5 (159.8, 162.5 vs 119.5 m respectively; p = 0.006), with the rest of the treatments showing intermediate values. The distance to the nearest cow was longer in T1 vs. T2 and T3 (6.2 vs 4.0 and 4.7 m, respectively; p = 0.007). Similarly, the herd home range was greater in T1 vs. T2 (792.6 vs. 574.7 m 2 , respectively; p = 0.01). Regardless of the treatment, social disruption occurred on day 1, which gradually decline through the week of grazing. The results show that the location of supplementary feed and water troughs affects the movement and cattle distribution in small (< 1 ha) irrigated swards. This might have practical applications in the design of grazing strategies and in the animal welfare of cattle maintained on small swards.","Solano, Jaime

"savedrecs (30).txt","Sheep can be exposed to a variety of challenges and failure to adapt to these challenges can compromise their health and wellbeing. Regular monitoring of stock on large-scale or extensive systems may not always be possible, although recent technological advancements in automated data capture, such as walk-over-weighing (WoW), can make monitoring easier. The potential benefit of including behavioural assessment in such a system has yet to be tested. We investigated whether quantitative and qualitative behavioural assessment (QBA) methods could be applied to short video footage collected automatically within a WoW setup, to differentiate between sheep that were, presumably, in different (positive and negative) welfare states. Video footage was collected from 36 Merino sheep within the four treatment groups; Control (n = 12), Habituated to the WoW setup and human interaction (n = 8), Lame (n = 8) and Inappetent (n = 8). Habituated sheep were exposed to a low-stress handling regimen for six consecutive days prior to filming. At the same time, feeding behaviour was recorded by means of radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology to identify sheep suffering inappetence. Lame sheep were identified using a 6-point scoring system, and Control animals were selected ensuring that they were not Lame, Inappetent or Habituated. For QBA, the footage was presented, in a random order, to 18 observers. There was a significant (P < 0.001) consensus among the observers in their assessment of the behavioural expression of the sheep. Observers described the Habituated and Lame sheep as significantly more focused/collected/assured compared to the Control sheep (P < 0.05). There was no difference in observer scores between the Inappetent sheep compared to the Controls. A number of associations were found between the QBA scores and the quantitative behavioural measures recorded. Sheep that baulked more frequently at the entrance to the WoW system (R-s = -0.70; P < 0.001) or had a greater number of circling events (R-s = -0.68; P < 0.001) were described as more reluctant/tense/wary, while those that recorded faster walking speeds (R-s = -0.65; P < 0.001) or spent less time standing stationary (R-s = -0.48; P < 0.01) were described as more focused/collected/assured. We conclude that qualitative and quantitative behavioural measures can be used to identify differences in animal behaviour, presumably related to their welfare state, when applied to short video clips automatically collected in a WoW setup. These findings suggest that behavioural measures could be collected, practically, within automated biometric data capture systems to provide additional information to aid in the assessment of sheep welfare in extensive systems.","Grant, Emily P.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Transporting sheep by sea exposes them to some prolonged floor motions, and their responses may depend on their space allowance. We simulated sea motion in a crate with a moveable and programmable floor, to measure behaviour and physiological responses. Nine sheep were exposed in groups of 3 for 1 h periods to Regular motion (8 roll of the floor every 15 s), Irregular motion (30 randomly selected amplitudes and duration of floor roll, with the same means as Regular), and No floor motion, at High (0.35 m(2)/head), Medium (0.30 m(2)/head), and Low (0.26 m(2)/head) space allowances, with Low representing the Australian shipping standard. Lying time (P < 0.001) and heart rate (P = 0.05) were reduced during regular motion, but aggression increased during irregular motion (P < 0.001), particularly at the end of the treatment. Both regular and irregular motion decreased rumination (P = 0.003) compared with control. Pushing (P = 0.03) and stepping (P < 0.001) were more frequent in the Low than Medium or High space allowance treatments, but only when the sheep experienced Regular motion, and particularly at the start of treatment (P = 0.03, P < 0.001) respectively. Low space allowance decreased lying time (P = 0.001) and variability in cardiac interbeat intervals (P < 0.001), increased aggression (P = 0.005) and the time sheep had their head facing downwards resting on the bars of the cage (P = 0.02), indicating stress. Therefore, both regular and irregular ship-like motion at a low space allowance led to responses that suggested stress; giving more space than the current Australian standards may increase the welfare of sheep transported by sea.","Navarro, Grisel

"savedrecs (30).txt","In commercial situations, laying hens must negotiate levels to reach resources such as food, water and litter. Providing ramps in aviary systems reduces collisions and resultant keel bone fractures in adults. We investigated whether providing ramps during rear improved the ability of birds to transition between levels.
Chicks were reared commercially in two flocks both of which provided access to raised structures from three weeks of age. One flock had no ramps, but the other flock was provided with additional access to two types of ramp (wooden ladders, and grids formed from commercial poultry slats placed at an angle). At 8 weeks of age, 64 birds (32 from each rearing condition) were transferred to an experimental facility. At 10 weeks of age, 32 pullets from each group were trained to run to a food reward. During testing at 12-14 weeks of age the pullets accessed the food reward by moving up or down a ramp. The pullets' behaviours and time taken to complete the task were recorded. Ramp use over three days was also observed in a room replicating a small-scale single-tier system. Four groups of 16 birds aged 12-14 weeks were housed for three days and the number of transitions between the raised tier and litter were recorded.
For upward transitions, more ramp-reared birds than control birds succeeded in reaching the food reward for both ladder (52% vs 13%) and grid ramps (74% vs 42%). Birds from the ramp-reared group took significantly less time to complete an upwards transition (68.8s +/- 49.3) than the control group (100s +/- 37.6) (p = 0.001). In addition, the control group showed more behaviours indicative of hesitancy (moving away, head orientations, ground pecking and crouching) before transitioning, and signs of difficulty when making upward transitions (crouched walks, pauses, turning, returning and escape attempts). In the group housing observations, the ramp reared groups had almost double the number of transitions between the slats and litter on day one compared to the control group. This difference was reduced by day three.
In summary, this suggests there are positive effects of providing ramp experience during rear shown by any combination of bird mobility, strength or cognitive ability leading to an increase in apparent confidence in older pullets. It is not known whether these benefits persist through to the laying period, but no detrimental effects were noted so we suggest that ramps should be included from the early rearing period onwards.","Norman, Kate I.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Animals develop behavioural strategies throughout life to improve their survival in nature. Juvenile activity and behaviour of the commercial tropical sea cucumber Stichopus cf. horrens were examined considering factors that may influence survival at this critical developmental stage. Wild juveniles were observed in situ to describe diel activity and movement. Wild and hatchery-reared juveniles were observed in the laboratory to evaluate the influence of different light-dark cycles and microhabitats on feeding and sheltering behaviour. All juveniles (4 - 54 g) displayed a distinct nocturnal activity pattern both in the field and laboratory. Nocturnal activity was strongly associated with feeding and locomotion. Wild and hatchery-reared juveniles were most active at night, displayed intermediate activity during twilight, and minimal to no activity during daytime. Movement rates of wild juveniles in situ were significantly influenced by time and size to a lesser extent. Under constant light and constant dark for 48 h, juvenile feeding rhythm was endogenously controlled and strongly entrained to natural light-dark cycles. Sheltering was directly affected by light and linked to strong phototactic and thigmotactic reflexes. Juveniles preferred vegetation as shelter compared to coral, sand or open space, and showed equal preference for seagrass and macroalgae. Deviations in behaviour of hatchery-reared juveniles under laboratory conditions indicate some degree of acclimation to an artificial environment with minimal threats and a decreased sensitivity to light. The implications of nocturnal feeding, light-induced sheltering, shelter preferences and acclimation to artificial conditions are discussed in relation to juvenile survival in nature and potential restocking of the species.","Palomar-Abesamis, Nadia

"savedrecs (30).txt","Animal migration has been the subject of intensive research for more than a century, but most research has focused on long-distance rather than short-distance migration. Altitudinal migration is a form of short-distance migration in which individuals perform seasonal elevational movements. Despite its geographic and taxonomic ubiquity, there is relatively little information about the intrinsic and extrinsic factors that influence altitudinal migratory behaviour. Without this information, it is difficult to predict how rapid environmental changes will affect population viability of altitudinal migrants. To synthesize current knowledge, we compiled literature on altitudinal migration for all studied taxa, and identified the leading hypotheses explaining this behaviour. Studies of animal altitudinal migration cover many taxonomic lineages, with birds being the most commonly studied group. Altitudinal migration occurs in all continents except for Antarctica, but about a third of the literature focused on altitudinal migration in North America. Most research suggests that food and weather are the primary extrinsic drivers of altitudinal migration. In addition, substantial individual-level variation in migratory propensity exists. Individual characteristics that are associated with sex, dominance rank, and body size explain much of the variation in migratory propensity in partially migratory populations, but individual-level correlates are poorly known for most taxa. More research is needed to quantify the effects of habitat loss, habitat fragmentation, and climate change on altitudinal migrants. Demographic studies of individually marked populations would be particularly valuable for advancing knowledge of the cascading effects of environmental change on migratory propensity, movement patterns, and population viability. We conclude our review with recommendations for study designs and modelling approaches that could be used to narrow existing knowledge gaps, which currently hinder effective conservation of altitudinal migratory species.","Hsiung, An C.

In this study, we used a fully coupled end-to-end ecosystem model to study the effect of climate variability on sardine recruitment in the California Current System during 1965-2006. Ocean variability was represented by ROMS hydrodynamic and NEMURO biogeochemical models, and sardine population dynamics was simulated through a full life cycle individual-based model. Model analysis was designed to elucidate how changes in abiotic and biotic conditions may impact the spawning habitats, early life stage survival, and ultimately recruitment of sardine. Our findings revealed the importance of spatial processes to shape early life stages dynamics. Shifts in spawning habitats were dictated by the spatial variations in temperature and the behavioral movement of adults. Additionally, the spatial match of eggs with warmer temperatures and larvae with their prey influenced their survival. The northward shifts in spawning locations and the accomplishment of good recruitment in warmer years agreed with existing knowledge. Egg production and survival during egg and yolk-sac larval stages were key factors to drive the long-term variations in recruitment. Finally, our analysis provided a quantitative assessment of climate impact on year-to-year variation in sardine recruitment by integrating multiple hypotheses.","Politikos, Dimitrios, V

"savedrecs (30).txt","1. Climate change poses a challenge to wild fishes, yet little is known about the behavioural use and metabolic consequences of thermally heterogeneous water encountered by wild salmon during their energetically demanding upstream spawning migration.
2. Temperature, body size and activity levels were modelled to predict energy depletion of salmon during their spawning migration in rivers. Archival temperature loggers revealed the thermal habitat of adult migrating Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar Salmonidae), which we used to apply bioenergetics models that estimated size-dependent temperature-driven metabolic expenditures as part of the costs of the migration.
3. Between July 16 and August 19, the mean water temperature experienced by salmon (t(FISH)) ranged from 11.5 to 18.0 degrees C (14.5 +/- 1.2 SD degrees C) and closely followed the ambient surface water temperature (t(RIVER)) of the river (11.5-18.5 degrees C; 14.8 +/- 1.4 degrees C) such that the regression equation t(FISH) = 3.24 + 0.76 (t(RIVER)) was highly correlated with observations (R-2 = 0.94).
4. Although temperature increases were predicted and confirmed to increase energetic costs, rates of energy depletion were more sensitive to changes in swimming speed and body size than to temperature increases in the range explored for this system.
5. We conclude that warming could contribute to changing life history phenotypes of salmon in some rivers, for example, delayed river entry or reduced probability of iteroparity, with potentially more dire consequences for smaller individuals.","Lennox, Robert J.

"savedrecs (30).txt","1. Advances in information technology are increasing the use of radar as a tool to investigate and monitor bird migration movements. We set up a field campaign to compare and validate outputs from different radar systems.
2. Here we compare the pattern of nocturnal bird migration movements recorded by four different radar systems at a site in southern Sweden. Within the range of the weather radar (WR) Angelholm, we operated a ""BirdScan"" (BS) dedicated bird radar, a standard marine radar (MR), and a tracking radar (TR).
3. The measures of nightly migration intensities, provided by three of the radars (WR, BS, MR), corresponded well with respect to the relative seasonal course of migration, while absolute migration intensity agreed reasonably only between WR and BS. Flight directions derived from WR, BS and TR corresponded very well, despite very different sample sizes. Estimated mean ground speeds differed among all four systems. The correspondence among systems was highest under clear sky conditions and at high altitudes.
4. Synthesis and applications. While different radar systems can provide useful information on nocturnal bird migration, they have distinct strengths and weaknesses, and all require supporting data to allow for species level inference. Weather radars continuously detect avian biomass flows across a wide altitude band, making them a useful tool for monitoring and predictive applications at regional to continental scales that do not rely on resolving individuals. BirdScan and marine radar's strengths are in local and low altitude applications, such as collision risks with man-made structures and airport safety, although marine radars should not be trusted for absolute intensities of movement. In quantifying flight behaviour of individuals, tracking radars are the most informative.","Nilsson, Cecilia

"savedrecs (30).txt","1. Reliable estimates of mortality have been a major gap in our understanding of population ecology for marine animals. This is especially true for juveniles, which are often the most vulnerable age class and whose survival can strongly influence population growth. Thousands of pop-up archival satellite tags (PAT) have been deployed on a variety of marine species, but analysis of these data has mainly been restricted to movement ecology and post-handling survival following fisheries bycatch. We used PAT data to provide empirical estimates of annual survival and cause-specific mortality for juveniles of a marine top predator.
2. We tagged and tracked juvenile white sharks in the northeastern Pacific Ocean to (1) estimate survival rates and competing risks and (2) investigate intrinsic and environmental influences on mortality risk. We also evaluated the use of PAT data with respect to meeting assumptions of known-fate survival models.
3. Annual juvenile survival rate was 0.632 (SE = 0.15) and annual natural mortality rate (0.08, SE = 0.06) was lower than the rate of gillnet interactions (0.48, SE = 0.15). Mortality risk decreased with greater body length and was significantly greater (hazard ratio = 9.05, SE = 0.70) for juvenile sharks in Mexican waters, relative to California waters.
4. The PAT data allowed for unambiguous determination of fate in most cases, aided by collaborative relationships with fishers and secondary tags deployed on a subset of sharks. Although caution must be exercised to establish whether assumptions are met, our work demonstrates that PAT data represent a widely available, untapped data source that could dramatically increase our understanding of marine population ecology.
5. Synthesis and applications. Our research shows fisheries bycatch to be the main source of mortality for juvenile white sharks in the northeastern Pacific Ocean, highlighting the need for best practices, such as releasing sharks quickly following incidental capture. Furthermore, mortality risk for juveniles was greater in Mexican waters, such that survival may be lower in colder years when juveniles are likely to move south seeking warmer water. This could increase stochasticity in juvenile survival and negatively influence population growth for this apex predator.","Benson, John F.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Dispersal (i.e. movement from a natal or breeding site to another breeding site) is a central process in ecology and evolution as it affects the eco-evolutionary dynamics of spatially structured populations. Dispersal evolution is regulated by the balance between costs and benefits, which is influenced by the individual phenotype (i.e. phenotype-dependent dispersal) and environmental factors (i.e. condition-dependent dispersal). Even though these processes have been extensively studied in species with simple life cycles, our knowledge about these mechanisms in organisms displaying complex life cycles remains fragmentary. In fact, little is specifically known about how the interplay between individual and environmental factors may lead to alternative dispersal strategies that, in turn, lead to the coexistence of contrasted site fidelity phenotypes. In this paper, we examined breeding dispersal in a pond-breeding amphibian, the great crested newt Triturus cristatus, within usual walking distances for a newt. We took advantage of recent developments in multi-event capture-recapture models and used capture-recapture data (946 newts marked) collected in a spatially structured population occupying a large pond network (73 ponds). We showed a high rate of breeding site infidelity (i.e. pond use) and the coexistence of two dispersal phenotypes, namely, a highly pond faithful phenotype and a dispersing phenotype. Individuals that were site faithful at time t - 1 were therefore more likely to remain site faithful at time t. Our results also demonstrated that the probability that individuals belong to one or the other dispersal phenotypes depended on environmental and individual factors. In particular, we highlighted the existence of a dispersal syndrome implying a covariation pattern among dispersal behavior, body size, and survival. Our work opens new research prospects in the evolution of dispersal in organisms displaying complex life cycles and raises interesting questions about the evolutionary pathways that contribute to the diversification of movement strategies in the wild.","Denoel, Mathieu

"savedrecs (30).txt","A global expansion of satellite-based monitoring is making fisher behavioral responses to management actions increasingly observable. However, such data have been underutilized in evaluating the impacts of fishing on target and non-target fish stocks or the ramifications of management strategies on fishers. We demonstrate how vessel monitoring system (VMS) data can provide a suite of metrics (such as effort) for improving inputs to stock assessments, dynamic delineation of fishing grounds, and evaluation of regulatory or other (e.g., climatic) impacts on fisher performance. Using > 1 million VMS records from the Gulf of Mexico grouper-tilefish demersal longline fishery, we first develop a generalized additive modeling approach that predicts fishing duration with similar to 85% accuracy. We combine model predictions with logbook data to compare the fishery before and after implementation of a suite of regulatory changes (e.g., a shift to catch share management). We find a large-scale reduction in fleet size, accompanied by reduced fishing effort (duration * number of hooks), shorter trips, lower operational expenses, higher catch rates, and more earnings for those vessels that remained in the fishery. We discuss how the combination of VMS and associated metrics can be expanded for use in management strategy evaluation, parameterizing economic models of fisher behavior, improving fishery-dependent stock assessment indices, and deriving socioeconomic indicators in fisheries worldwide.","Watson, Jordan T.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Human activity has caused longitudinal fragmentation of many rivers. Fishways have been installed worldwide, but their successive use by potamodromous species remains poorly documented, particularly in large river ecosystems. Four vertical slot fishways were installed within a 32-km stretch of the lower Belgian Meuse River basin. From 2012 to 2016, n = 532 individuals belonging to 11 potamodromous fish species (rheophilic, limnophilic and large carnivorous) were continuously captured in the most downstream fishway (M-0), tagged with an RFID transponder and released upstream. These could be further detected in upstream river part within three fishways (M-1 and M-2 in the Meuse, and O-1 in an important tributary, the Ourthe) that were equipped with RFID detection stations. In the first downstream stretch (13 km from M-0 to M-1) we quantified an ascending rate until M-1 (number of individuals detected in M-1/number of individuals tagged in M-0) of 32.9% including all individuals tagged, with a maximum value of 67.2% for chub (Squalius cephalus), 40% for pike (Esox Lucius) and 35.5% for nase (Chondrostoma nasus), and a progression time M-0 to M-1 of 1.1 days per kilometre (d/km), with trout (Salm trutta) as the fastest species (0.3 d/km). Upstream of the M-1 fishway, many individuals of rheophilic species (trout and barbel, Barbus barbus) preferred to enter in the Ourthe tributary (detection at the Ourthe fishway) unlike the upstream Meuse (detection at the most upstream fishway in the Meuse), demonstrating a new accessibility to more adapted spawning sites. Most fish were present within fishways mainly in spring during the circum-spawning migration, and during summer and autumn for dispersal and/or seeking-refuge. The diel activity cycle varied depending on the species, with detection during the entire diel cycle (e.g. chub and barbel), during the day (e.g. trout) and during the night (e.g. catfish, Silurus glanis). The installation of fishways in the degraded river Meuse can be considered adequate for the restoration of the free movement because potamodromous species demonstrated their ability to migrate over long distances (> 20 km) and to reach potential spawning habitats through the reopened access to a tributary.","Benitez, Jean-Philippe

"savedrecs (30).txt","Recreational fisheries are increasingly important sectors of tourism-based economies. In the last decade, new recreational fisheries have emerged that target species of varying conservation status including vulnerable, endangered, and unassessed species. In Guyana, catch-and-release angling tourism has begun to target arapaima, a genus of giant air-breathing fishes. Given the uncertain conservation status of this species and that no information is available to evaluate the sustainability of this activity, we sought to describe the responses of arapaima to recreational angling. We harnessed tri-axial accelerometer biologgers around the trunk of fish that had been captured and released by recreational anglers, allowing us to monitor post-release survival and behaviour, including surfacing, which is essential for this air-breathing fish to recover from exhaustion. Twenty-seven individuals were instrumented (162 +/- 25 cm), 24 of which were considered survivors (89%) during the 47 +/- 35 (SD) min monitoring period. Fish that died were observed to drown soon after release (i.e. within minutes), not surfacing to breathe air. Supervised machine learning classification of behaviours using a random forest algorithm identified surfacing events with 80% accuracy (i.e. out-of-bag error rate = 20%), which we applied to unobserved data periods to estimate breathing frequency after release, along with overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA) as a proxy for activity. Neither mean breathing frequency nor ODBA were related to body size (total length), handling time (which incorporated facilitated recovery of individuals), nor time of capture (early or late in the dry season spanning water temperatures of 29.3-34.1 degrees C). The precise angling related factors that led to arapaima mortality were unclear, but the frequency of mortality aligns with the mortality documented in other recreational fisheries. This mortality source can be incorporated into conservation plans and provide context to the impacts of recreational angling relative to the costs of legal or illegal harvest.","Lennox, Robert J.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Narrow seat aisle is an important part of vehicle car interior, and previous studies on pedestrian dynamics in such area is still insufficient. To improve this situation, experiments of individual and single-file pedestrian movement were performed. Discussions were carried out from the aspect of walking speed, headways distance, and fundamental diagram. It is shown that walking speed of individual pedestrian grows exponentially fast to an asymptotic value as aisle width increases, and the width of 0.40 m is wide enough to allow a smooth walking. In the single-file movement, pedestrian walking speed can also be affected by headways distance and the predecessors. Also, existence of inactive pedestrian interferes the pedestrian flow, slowing down the flow rate or even causing a jam. Moreover, linear fitting models introduced in this paper, which link the motion of individual and single-file pedestrian, are able to well predict the movement speeds. This study will provides reference for the safety design of similar seat area in vehicle cars. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","Huang, Shenshi

"savedrecs (30).txt","Metastatic cancer cells differ from their non-metastatic counterparts not only in terms of molecular composition and genetics, but also by the very strategy they employ for locomotion. Here, we analyzed large-scale statistics for cells migrating on linear microtracks to show that metastatic cancer cells follow a qualitatively different movement strategy than their non-invasive counterparts. The trajectories of metastatic cells display clusters of small steps that are interspersed with long ""flights"". Such movements are characterized by heavy-tailed, truncated power law distributions of persistence times and are consistent with the Levy walks that are also often employed by animal predators searching for scarce prey or food sources. In contrast, non-metastatic cancerous cells perform simple diffusive movements. These findings are supported by preliminary experiments with cancer cells migrating away from primary tumors in vivo. The use of chemical inhibitors targeting actin-binding proteins allows for ""reprogramming"" the Levy walks into either diffusive or ballistic movements.","Huda, Sabil

"savedrecs (30).txt","The study of animal behavior, especially regarding welfare, needs the development of tools to identify, quantify and compare animal postures with interobserver reliability. While most studies subjectively describe animal postures, or quantify only limited parts of the body, the usage of geometric morphometrics has allowed for the description of horses' and pigs' upper body outline and the comparison of postures from different populations thanks to robust statistical analysis. We have attempted here to optimize the geometric morphometrics (GM) method already used in horses by introducing the outline analysis with sliding semilandmarks (SSL), by eliminating the balance movement of the neck and by focusing only on parts of the upper line. For this purpose, photographs of 85 horses from 11 riding schools, known for differing in terms of housing and working conditions, were analyzed with previous and new GM methods and these results were compared with each other. Using SSL and eliminating the neck movement appeared to better discriminate the horse populations than the previous GM method. Study of parts of the dorsum proved efficient too. This new methodology should now be used to examine if posture could be an indicator of horse welfare state, and similar studies should be performed in other species in order to validate the same methodology.","Seneque, Emilie

"savedrecs (30).txt","Mammalian predators encounter unique hunting challenges during the winter as snow increases the cost of locomotion and influences predator-prey interactions. Winter precipitation may also affect predators' ability to detect and pursue prey. We investigated the effects of snowfall events on grey wolves (Canis lupus) in a boreal forest ecosystem in northeastern Alberta, Canada. We predicted that wolves would respond to snowfall events by reducing their travel speed and the time they spent travelling. Over the course of two winters, we used remote cameras to identify localized snowfall events and estimate snow depth. We used telemetry data from 17 wolves to calculate travel speed and time spent travelling versus resting. Data were categorized by time of day (night versus day) and time since snowfall events, and analyzed using linear and logistic regression mixed-effects models. We found that wolves were less likely to travel on dates of snowfall events than any date prior to or after an event. Wolves also travelled slower during snowfall events, but only when compared to their travel speed 24 hours before. Effects were most pronounced at night, when movements appeared to be consistent with hunting behavior, and activity levels resumed within 24 hours of a snowfall event. Including snow depth as a variable did not improve model fit. Collectively, our findings suggest that wolves' response is not driven by increased hunting success or by energetic considerations resulting from increased snow depth. Instead, we propose that wolves reduce their activity levels because precipitation dampens hunting success. Snowfall events may impact wolves' ability to detect prey and changes in prey behavior could also lead to decreased encounter rates. We encourage scientists to further investigate the effects of short-term weather events on movement rates and predator-prey interactions.","Droghini, Amanda

"savedrecs (30).txt","Efforts to better understand patterns of animal behaviour have often been restricted by several environmental, human and experimental limitations associated with the collection of animal behavioural data. The introduction of new bio-logging technology has offered an alternative means of recording animal behaviour continuously and is being used in an increasing number of studies. Accurately calibrating these bio-loggers, however, still remains a challenge in many cases. Using lions as an example species, we test how audio recordings from animal-borne acoustic sensors can improve calibration and behaviour classification. Through a collaborative effort between computer scientists, engineers, and zoologists, custom designed acoustic bio-loggers were fitted to eight lions and recorded audio simultaneously with accelerometer and magnetometer data. Audio recordings were then used as the source of ground truth to train random forest classification models as well as to provide additional predictor variables for behaviour classification. We demonstrated near-perfect classification performance for five lion behaviour classes when all component variables were combined, with an average per-class precision of 98.5%. Using accelerometer features only, the audio-trained classifier predicted behaviours with an average per-class precision of 94.3%. On-animal audio recordings are therefore able to provide a valuable source of ground-truth for calibrating bio-loggers while also offering additional predictive features for increasing the accuracy of behaviour classification. This technological innovation has wide ranging application and provides a useful tool for behavioural ecologists wishing to collect fine scale behavioural data for animal research and conservation.","Wijers, Matthew

"savedrecs (30).txt","Objective
Regulating health behavior change often occurs in a dyadic context of romantic relationships. Dyadic approaches to standard health behavior change models are, however, barely considered. We investigated volitional processes of the Health Action Process Approach model for two health behaviors within a dyadic context of romantic couples. Specifically, we tested whether day-to-day volitional self-regulation predicted one's own and one's partner's cigarettes smoked (Study 1) and physical activity (Study 2).
Methods
In two dyadic intensive longitudinal studies (Study 1: 83 dual-smoker couples intending to jointly quit smoking; Study 2: 61 overweight couples intending to become physically active), heterosexual partners independently reported on intention, self-efficacy, action planning, and action control in end-of-day diaries. In Study 1, daily number of cigarettes smoked was assessed via self-report. In Study 2, daily moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) was assessed objectively via accelerometers. In both studies, dyadic cross-lagged intensive longitudinal analyses based on the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model were applied.
Results
Across both studies, individual's own volitional self-regulation positively predicted one's own health behavior (less cigarettes smoked and more MVPA). One's partner's action control and intention also positively predicted one's own health behavior. A marginal partner effect for self-efficacy was found in the context of smoking only.
Conclusions
Behavioral self-regulation is not only relevant for individuals themselves, but some volitional processes may spill over to their partners. This highlights the need to specify couple-level processes involved in health behavior change, and to consider a social context of self-regulation.","Berli, Corina

"savedrecs (30).txt","Human fisheries inadvertently attract and provide food for a range of wild organisms worldwide with important ecological consequences. Some animals directly feed on human catch ('depredators', e.g. killer whales), causing economical losses and calling for wildlife management. However the impact of depredation (and its potential management) on the behaviour of the other scavengers attracted to vessels (e.g. seabirds) is unknown. We examined how the fine-scale behavioural response of wandering albatrosses to a toothfish longline fleet was influenced by the presence of depredating killer and/or sperm whales. We hypothesized that the presence of depredating whales might facilitate detection of and/or access to food at fishing vessels for surface-feeding albatrosses. We used seabird GPS tracking together with a vessel monitoring system (GPS vessel tracking) coupled with systematic onboard records of depredator numbers during 3 fishing seasons. We found that when albatrosses 'encountered' vessels (n = 254), they had the same probability to start attending vessels whether or not cetaceans were present. However, once attracted, they attended the vessel longer when depredators were present. We conclude that birds are attracted to vessels independently of the presence of cetaceans, but that depredating whales probably facilitate access to food for surface-feeding birds such as the wandering albatross. Scavenging behaviour of seabirds does not appear to be strongly dependent on the presence of depredating cetaceans and is likely minimally affected by changes in cetacean behaviour. This type of data is rare and we discuss how these results for wandering albatrosses could be generalized for other seabird species.","Collet, Julien

"savedrecs (30).txt","Forage fish are ecologically important to the marine environment, creating a wasp-waist trophic structure whereby many piscivorous diets are composed of a low diversity of mid-trophic species. Despite the importance of these species, knowledge of their abundance, distribution, and interactions with predators is often limited. On Middleton Island, Alaska, USA, we coupled biologging (GPS-depth logging) with long-term diet observations to examine the use of rhinoceros auklets Cerorhinca monocerata chick diets as an ecologically relevant method to sample forage fish in the Gulf of Alaska. Individual rhinoceros auklets did not specialize on select prey items but did specialize on 1 of 2 foraging sites, foraging either in coastal waters or the continental shelf. The majority of forage fish in bill-loads were captured in the top 15 m of the water column. Prey composition in auklet bill-loads varied among and within sampling years (2003-2016). Capelin Mallotus villosus dominated auklet diets during the cold-water period with negative Pacific Decadal Oscillation values (2008-2013), whereas Pacific sand lance Ammodytes hexapterus were more common in warmer years. Bill-load composition changed within years, with sand lance and capelin delivered to younger chicks, and larger fish, like sablefish Anoplopoma fimbria, being introduced as the chicks aged. Auklets returned with sand lance in foraging areas where trawling detected none, implying that auklets can potentially detect fish availability at finer resolutions than conventional methods. In conclusion, auklets responded to variation in forage fish among and across years. These changes in seabird diet could expand our knowledge of changes in availability of important prey species.","Cunningham, Joshua T.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Water is a scarce resource in semi-arid savannas where over half of the African elephants (Loxodonta africana) populations occur and may therefore influence their movement pattern. A random search is expected for an animal with no information on the location of the target resource, else, a direction-oriented walk is expected. We hypothesized that elephants movement patterns show a stronger directional orientation toward water sources in the dry season compared to the wet season. We investigated the movement paths of four male and four female elephants with hourly GPS fixes in Tsavo National Park, Kenya in 2012-2013. Consistent with our predictions, the movement paths of elephants had longer step lengths, longer squared net displacements, and were directed toward water sources in the dry season as compared to the wet season. We argue that African elephants know the location of dispersed water resources, enabling them to survive with scarce resources in dry savannas. These results can be used in conservation and management of wildlife, through for instance, protection of preferred water sources.","Wato, Yussuf A.

The quantity and format of data generated by the Motus system is unprecedented and requires novel statistical methods. Building from the bsam package in R, we propose new biologically informed Bayesian state-space models for animal movement in JAGS that include informed assumptions about behavior. To apply the models, we employed a localization routine on a Motus data set from migrating Red-eyed Vireos (Vireo olivaceus). This allowed us to apply the new models to estimate unobserved locations and behaviors. Directed migratory flights were detected at night and often over water (e.g. the Bay of Fundy, the Long Island Sound and the New York Bight). Migratory flights were not exclusively nocturnal.","Baldwin, Justin W.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Assessments of connectivity are subject to the limitations imposed by the technique used to model species movement. Least-cost path analysis is one such commonly applied technique that has a number of associated limitations that are often discounted, such as the assumption of individual omniscience or symmetrical movement between patches. We contend that not accounting for methodological limitations may lead to inaccurate assessments of connectivity, and thus there is a need for more robust and adaptable approaches. Using simulated data and in a case study on Ord's kangaroo rat (Dipodomys ordii), we present an approach that uses effective distance, in this case calculated from least-cost paths, in combination with a spatial interaction model (SIM), which allows one to incorporate additional landscape characteristics and interactions influencing movement, thereby overcoming key assumptions and limitations associated with the least-cost framework. We show how various factors influencing connectivity can be incorporated, how outputs from the SIM can be used to quantify connectivity, how outputs from different models may be compared, and, importantly, that in both a simulated and empirical case study application, the assessment of functional connectivity is sensitive to small changes to the model.","Koenig, Shantel J.

Bayesian models suggest that humans compensate for measurement noise and reduce behavioral variability by biasing perception toward prior expectations. Whether a similar strategy is employed to compensate for noise in downstream mental and sensorimotor computations is not known. We tested humans in a battery of tasks and found that tasks which involved more complex mental transformations resulted in increased bias, suggesting that humans are able to mitigate the effect of noise in both sensorimotor and mental transformations. These results indicate that humans delay inference in order to account for both measurement noise and noise in downstream computations.","Remington, Evan D.

"savedrecs (30).txt","An animal's home-range can be expected to encompass the resources it requires for surviving or reproducing. Thus, animals inhabiting a heterogeneous landscape, where resource patches vary in size, shape and distribution, will naturally have home-ranges of varied sizes, so that each home-range encompasses a minimum required amount of a resource. Homerange size can be estimated from telemetry data, and often key resources, or proxies for them such as the areas of important habitat types, can be mapped. We propose a new method, Resource-Area-Dependence Analysis (RADA), which uses a sample of tracked animals and a categorical map to i) infer in which map categories important resources are accessible, ii) within which home range cores they are found, and iii) estimate the mean minimum areas of these map categories required for such resource provision. We provide three examples of applying RADA to datasets of radio-tracked animals from southern England: 15 red squirrels Sciurus vulgaris, 17 gray squirrels S. carolinensis and 114 common buzzards Buteo buteo. The analyses showed that each red squirrel required a mean (95% CL) of 0.48 ha (0.24-0.97) of pine wood within the outermost home-range, each gray squirrel needed 0.34 ha (0.11-1.12) ha of mature deciduous woodland and 0.035-0.046 ha of wheat, also within the outermost home-range, while each buzzard required 0.54 ha (0.35-0.82) of rough ground close to the home-range center and 14 ha (11-17) of meadow within an intermediate core, with 52% of them also relying on 0.41 ha (0.29-0.59) of suburban land near the homerange center. RADA thus provides a useful tool to infer key animal resource requirements during studies of animal movement and habitat use.","Kenward, Robert E.

"savedrecs (30).txt","The transition from occasional to obligate bipedalism is a milestone in human evolution. However, because the fossil record is fragmentary and reconstructing behaviour from fossils is difficult, changes in the motor control strategies that accompanied this transition remain unknown. Quadrupedal primates that adopt a bipedal stance while using percussive tools provide a unique reference point to clarify one aspect of this transition, which is maintaining bipedal stance while handling massive objects. We found that while cracking nuts using massive stone hammers, wild bearded capuchin monkeys (Sapajits libidinosus) produce hammer trajectories with highly repeatable spatial profiles. Using an uncontrolled manifold analysis, we show that the monkeys used strong joint synergies to stabilize the hammer trajectory while lifting and lowering heavy hammers. The monkeys stringently controlled the motion of the foot. They controlled the motion of the lower arm and hand rather loosely, showing a greater variability across strikes. Overall, our findings indicate that while standing bipedally to lift and lower massive hammers, an arboreal quadrupedal primate must control motion in the joints of the lower body more stringently than motion in the joints of the upper body. Similar changes in the structure of motor variability required to accomplish this goal could have accompanied the evolutionary transition from occasional to obligate bipedalism in ancestral hominins.","Mangalam, Madhur

"savedrecs (30).txt","BackgroundThe Arctic is experiencing rapid reductions in sea ice and in some areas tidal glaciers are melting and retracting onto land. These changes are occurring at extremely rapid rates in the Northeast Atlantic Arctic. The aim of this study was to investigate the impacts of these environmental changes on space use by white whales (Delphinapterus leucas) in Svalbard, Norway. Using a unique biotelemetry data set involving 34 animals, spanning two decades, habitat use and movement patterns were compared before (1995-2001) and after (2013-2016) a dramatic change in the regional sea ice regime that began in 2006.ResultsWhite whales were extremely coastal in both study periods, remaining near the islands within the Svalbard Archipelago, even when winter sea ice formation pushed them offshore somewhat (later in the year in the recent period), into areas with drifting sea ice (concentrations up to 90%). In both periods, the whales followed the same basic patterns seasonally; they occupied the west coast in summer and shifted to the east coast as winter approached. However, space use did change between the two periods, with the whales spending less time close to tidal glacier fronts in the second period compared to the first (2(nd)-36% vs 1(st)-51%), a habitat characterized by low swimming speeds and high turning angles, and more time out in the fjords (2(nd)-26% vs1(st)-10%). Use of coastal transit corridors remained the same in both periods; the whales appear to minimize time spent moving between fjords.ConclusionsGlacier fronts have previously been shown to be important foraging areas for white whales in Svalbard and the movement metrics documented in this study confirms that this is still the case. However, use of the Fjords habitat in summer and fall (frequency of occupancy and movement metrics) seen in the recent period suggests that the white whales might now also be feeding on Atlantic prey that is increasingly common in the fjords, concomitant with influxes of Atlantic Water along the west coast of Svalbard. Such behavioural flexibility, if confirmed by further diet studies, would likely be important for white whales in adapting to new conditions in Svalbard.","Vacquie-Garcia, Jade

"savedrecs (30).txt","As marine predators experience increasing anthropogenic pressures, there is an urgent need to understand their distribution and their drivers to inform spatial conservation planning. We used an ensemble modelling approach to investigate the spatio-temporal distribution of southern Australian bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops cf. australis) in relation to a variety of ecogeographical and anthropogenic variables in Coffin Bay, Thorny Passage Marine Park, South Australia. Further, we evaluated the overlap between current spatial management measures and important dolphin habitat. Dolphins showed no distinct seasonal shifts in distribution patterns. Models of the entire study area indicate that zones of high probability of dolphin occurrence were located mainly within the inner area of Coffin Bay. In the inner area, zones with high probability of dolphin occurrence were associated with shallow waters (2-4 m and 7-10 m) and located within 1,000 m from land and 2,500 m from oyster farms. The multimodal response curve of depth in the models likely shows how the different dolphin communities in Coffin Bay occupy different embayments characterized by distinct depth patterns. The majority of areas of high (> 0.6) probability of dolphin occurrence are outside sanctuary zones where multiple human activities are allowed. The inner area of Coffin Bay is an important area of year-round habitat suitability for dolphins. Our results can inform future spatial conservation decisions and improve protection of important dolphin habitat.","Passadore, Cecilia

"savedrecs (30).txt","Introduction
Aging is associated with a progressive decrease in bone mass (BM), and being physical active is one of the main strategies to combat this continuous loss. Nonetheless, because daily time is limited, time spent on each movement behavior is co-dependent. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between BM and movement behaviors in elderly people using compositional data analysis.
Methods
We analyzed 871 older people [395 men (76.9 +/- 5.3y) and 476 women (76.7 +/- 4.7y)]. Time spent in sedentary behavior (SB), light physical activity (LPA) and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), was assessed using accelerometry. BM was determined by bone densitometry (DXA). The sample was divided according to sex and bone health indicators.
Results
The combined effect of all movement behaviors (PA and SB) was significantly associated with whole body, leg and femoral region BM in the whole sample (p<0.05), with leg and pelvic BM (p<0.05) in men and, with whole body, arm and leg BM (p<0.05) in women. In men, arm and pelvic BM were negatively associated with SB and whole body, pelvic and leg BM were positively associated with MVPA (p<0.05). In women, whole body and leg BM were positively associated with SB. Arm and whole body BM were positively associated and leg BM was negatively associated with LPA and arm BM was negatively associated with MVPA (p<0.05). Women without bone fractures spent less time in SB and more in LPA and MVPA than the subgroup with bone fractures.
Conclusion
We identified that the positive effect of MVPA relative to the other behaviors on bone mass is the strongest overall effect in men. Furthermore, women might decrease bone fracture risk through PA increase and SB reduction, despite the fact that no clear benefits of PA for bone mass were found.","Rodriguez-Gomez, Irene

"savedrecs (30).txt","Background. The proportion of overweight and obese people has increased tremendously in a short period, culminating in a worldwide trend of obesity that is reaching epidemic proportions. Overweight and obesity are serious issues, especially with regard to children. This is because obese children have twice the risk of becoming obese as adults, as compared to non-obese children. Nowadays, many methods for maintaining a caloric balance exist; however, these methods are not applicable to children. In this study, a new approach for helping children monitor their activities using a convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed, which is applicable for real-time scenarios requiring high accuracy.
Methods. A total of 136 participants (86 boys and 50 girls), aged between 8.5 years and 12.5 years (mean 10.5, standard deviation 1.1), took part in this study. The participants performed various movement while wearing custom-made three-axis accelerometer modules around their waists. The data acquired by the accelerometer module was preprocessed by dividing them into small sets (128 sample points for 2.8 s). Approximately 183,600 data samples were used by the developed CNN for learning to classify ten physical activities : slow walking, fast walking, slow running, fast running, walking up the stairs, walking down the stairs, jumping rope, standing up, sitting down, and remaining still.
Results. The developed CNN classified the ten activities with an overall accuracy of 81.2%. When similar activities were merged, leading to seven merged activities, the CNN classified activities with an overall accuracy of 91.1%. Activity merging also improved performance indicators, for the maximum case of 66.4% in recall, 48.5% in precision, and 57.4% in fl score . The developed CNN classifier was compared to conventional machine learning algorithms such as the support vector machine, decision tree, and k-nearest neighbor algorithms, and the proposed CNN classifier performed the best: CNN (81.2%) > SVM (64.8%) > DT (63.9%) > kNN (55.4%) (for ten activities); CNN (91.1%) > SVM (74.4%) > DT (73.2%) > kNN (65.3%) (for the merged seven activities).
Discussion. The developed algorithm distinguished physical activities with improved time resolution using short-time acceleration signals from the physical activities performed by children. This study involved algorithm development, participant recruitment, IRB approval, custom-design of a data acquisition module, and data collection. The self-selected moving speeds for walking and running (slow and fast) and the structure of staircase degraded the performance of the algorithm. However, after similar activities were merged, the effects caused by the self-selection of speed were reduced. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm performed better than conventional algorithms. Owing to its simplicity, the proposed algorithm could be applied to real-time applicaitons.","Jang, Yongwon

"savedrecs (30).txt","Animals that do not provide parental care have to secure the survival of their offspring by ensuring a safe reproductive environment or smart timing tactics. Nocturnal spawning behaviour of many fish species is an example of the latter behaviour in the animal kingdom and is hypothesized to provide a survival advantage to the eggs spawned during the night. In order to test the efficiency of the smart timing tactics in a freshwater fish, a study was carried out of the interaction of the rheophilic spawner (asp Leuciscus aspius) and the predator of its drifting eggs (bleak Alburnus alburnus) using passive telemetry. According to a model based on acquired data, asp laid 63% of its eggs at night, while vision-oriented bleak was present in 92% of the time during the day. This study gives support to the predator avoidance hypothesis, which expects animals to reproduce in a period when the probability of offspring predation is at its lowest.","Smejkal, Marek

"savedrecs (30).txt","Marine protected areas (MPAs) can be useful for conservation efforts, yet the effectiveness of MPAs relies on their size and location, as well as the spatial ecology of the focal species. We investigated the effectiveness of a small MPA adjacent to Cape Cod, MA (USA) for protecting American horseshoe crabs (Limulus polyphemus). We used a fixed acoustic telemetry array to study the spatial ecology of 24 adult horseshoe crabs off the coast of Chatham, Massachusetts, from June 2010 to November 2011. Two groups of horseshoe crabs were tagged in spawning habitats (separated by similar to 2.0 km) with differing commercial harvesting pressure: one group inside Stage Harbor where harvesting is permitted, and the other within Monomoy National Wildlife Refuge and the Cape Cod National Seashore (the MPA) where harvesting is prohibited. In the first year of study, crabs tagged in the MPA did not go to Stage Harbor, but instead remained in the MPA and adjacent high-energy beach, whereas crabs tagged in Stage Harbor moved throughout the entire study area. In the second year of study, crabs from both tagging locations used all areas. All crabs generally moved greater distances in the MPA than in other areas, and the majority of movement we recorded was in late spring and summer. All crabs that we tagged used similar areas around Cape Cod. The MPA only provides protection when crabs are in that area, which may only be for a few months of the year. Given that all crabs used Stage Harbor, they were all exposed to potential harvest, but the MPA did provide some protection for all crabs.","Martinez, Sarah E. D.

We propose a deterministic model to study the importation and local transmission of these mosquito-borne diseases. The purpose is to model and mimic the importation of these viruses to Florida via travelers, local infections in domestic mosquitoes by imported travelers, and finally non-travel related transmissions to local humans by infected local mosquitoes. As a case study, the model will be used to simulate the accumulative Zika cases in Florida. Since the disease system is driven by a continuing input of infections from outside sources, orthodox analytic methods based on the calculation of the basic reproduction number are inadequate to describe and predict their behavior. Via steady-state analysis and sensitivity analysis, effective control and prevention measures for these mosquito-borne diseases are tested. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Chen, Jing

"savedrecs (30).txt","A theoretical and applied literature has suggested that foragers search using Levy flights, since Levy flights can maximize the efficiency of search in the absence of information on the location of randomly distributed prey. Foragers, however, often have available to them at least some information about the distribution of prey, gained either through evolved mechanisms, experience and memory, or social transmission of information. As such, we might expect selection for heuristics that make use of such information to further improve the efficiency of random search. Here we present a general model of random search behavior that includes as special cases: area-restricted search, correlated random walks, Brownian search, and Levy flights. This generative model allows foragers to adjust search parameters based on encounter conditional and other heuristics. Using a simulation model, we demonstrate the efficiency gains of these search heuristics, and illustrate the resulting differences in the distributions of step-size and heading angle change they imply, relative to Levy flights. We conclude by presenting a statistical model that can be fit to empirical data and a set of testable, quantitative predictions that contrast our model of adaptive search with the Levy flight foraging hypothesis.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Background: Objective assessments of sedentary behavior and physical activity (PA) by using accelerometer-based wearable devices are ever expanding, given their importance in the global context of health maintenance. This study aimed to determine the reliability and validity of a new accelerometer-based analyzer (Fibion) for detecting different PAs and estimating energy expenditure (EE) during a simulated free-living day.
Methods: The study consisted of two parts: a reliability (n = 18) and a validity (n = 19) test. Reliability was assessed by a 45 min protocol of repeated sitting, standing, and walking (i.e., 3 x 15 min, repeated twice), using both Fibion and ActiGraph. Validity was assessed by a 12 h continuous sequence tasks of different types (sitting, standing, walking, and cycling) and intensities (light [LPA], moderate [MPA], and vigorous [VPA]) of PA. Two Fibion devices were worn on the thigh (FT) and in the pocket (FP), respectively and were compared with criteria measures, such as direct observation (criterion 1) and oxygen consumption by a portable gas analyzer, K4b(2) (criterion 2).
Results: FT (intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs): 0.687-0.806) provided similar reliability as the Actigraph (ICCs: 0.661-0.806) for EE estimation. However, the measurement error (ME) of FT compared to the actual time records indicated an underestimation of duration by 5.1 +/- 1.2%, 3.8 +/- 0.3% and 14.9 +/- 2.6% during sitting, walking, and standing, respectively. During the validity test, FT but not FP showed a moderate agreement but lager variance with the criteria (1 and 2) in assessing duration of sitting, long sitting, LPA, MPA, and VPA (p > 0.05, ICCs: 0.071-0.537), as well as for EE estimation of standing, LPA, MPA, and VPA (p > 0.05, ICCs: 0.673-0.894).
Conclusions: FT provided similar reliability to that of the Actigraph. However, low correlations between subsequent measurements of both devices indicated large random MEs, which were somewhat diminished during the simulated 12 h real-life test. Furthermore, FT may accurately determine the types, intensities of PA and EE during prolonged periods with substantial changes in postures, indicating that the location of the accelerometer is essential. Further study with a large cohort is needed to confirm the usability of Fibion, especially for detecting the low-intensity PAs.","Yang, Yanxiang

"savedrecs (30).txt","Despite increasing work detailing the presence of foraging specializations across a range of taxa, limited attention so far has been given to the role of spatiotemporal variation in food predictability in shaping individual resource selection. Here, we studied the exploitation of human-provided carrion resources differing in predictability by Canarian Egyptian vultures (Neophron percnopterus majorensis). We focussed specifically on the role of individual characteristics and spatial constraints in shaping patterns of resource use. Using high-resolution GPS data obtained from 45 vultures tracked for 1 year, we show that individual vultures were repeatable in both their monthly use of predictable and semi-predicable resources (feeding station vs. farms) and monthly levels of mobility (home range size and flight activity). However, individual foraging activities were simultaneously characterized by a high degree of (temporal) plasticity in the use of the feeding station in specific months. Individual rank within dominance hierarchy revealed sex-dependent effects of social status on resource preference in breeding adults, illustrating the potential complex social mechanisms underpinning status-dependent resource use patterns. Our results show that predictable food at feeding stations may lead to broad-scale patterns of resource partitioning and affect both the foraging and social dynamics within local vulture populations.","van Overveld, Thijs

"savedrecs (30).txt","Dogs (Canis familiaris) are among the most abundant and widely distributed carnivores worldwide, and their presence can have negative impacts on native fauna. This study investigated the invasion of cacao agroforests by free-ranging dogs in Brazil. By monitoring the behavior of dogs using direct observations, we assessed whether direct (chasing and predation) and indirect (urine and fecal deposition) interactions with wildlife are more common when dogs enter the agroforests with humans than when they stay outside. We also compared the time that dogs spent inside versus outside the agroforests, and estimated their areas of use. The dogs (n = 10) spent a small fraction of the time without their owners, and only when moving inside the cacao agroforests. The dogs fed and rested more in open habitats and house surroundings than in agroforests, but they were more active and depredated wildlife exclusively in the latter. Kernel estimates of space use at the 50% and 95% levels ranged from 1 to 46 ha and 6 to 202 ha, respectively. Most of the area used by dogs was within cacao agroforest, while core areas were concentrated near human residences and in places of owner permanence in cacao agroforest. Human movement was a key determining factor in the use of space by the dogs. Changes to human behaviors toward their dogs must be considered if the direct and indirect impacts of dogs on wildlife are to be mitigated.","dos Santos, Claudia L. A.

"savedrecs (30).txt","In furtive predation, a predator is able to exploit its prey without generating significant defensive behaviors from them. However, in aphidophagous guild, if furtive predator can benefit from dilution effects generated by the aphids, they also suffer from intraguild predation from more mobile and active-searching predators. In this context ant-tended aphid colonies might not only represent an important food source but also potentially an enemy-free space for furtive predators if they remain unharmed by ants while other active predators are being repelled. Here we use the furtive predator Aphidoletes aphidimyza and two distinct instars of an active-searching predator, the Asian ladybeetle Harmonia axyridis, to test hypotheses related to predator persistence within aphid colonies in presence of ants. Our results show that persistence rate over time of the furtive predator was not affected by ant presence while it was strongly reduced for both instars of the active-searching predator. Furthermore, when ran in paired trials within ant-tended aphid colonies, furtive predator persistence rate was significantly higher than for active-searching predators, with these latter always leaving the plants quicker. Finally, we tested the importance of predator mobility in detection susceptibility and aggressive responses in ants using mobile and immobile active-searching predators. While the number of antennal palpations was similar for both treatments indicating similar detection rate, the number of ant attacks was significantly higher on mobile individuals highlighting the importance of movement in triggering aggressive responses in ants. Overall our results indicate that furtive predation represents an efficient strategy to limit ant aggressions, while the exclusion of active-searching predators might create an enemy-free space for furtive predators within ant-tended aphid colonies.","Guenard, Benoit

"savedrecs (30).txt","Vibrational communication is known in some subterranean insects. Except for their use in sexual signaling, vibration behavior has rarely been reported. We report here four distinct types of substrate-based vibration behaviors in the mole cricket, Gryllotalpa orientalis, which are not associated with sexual signaling because of the occurrence of these behaviors in nymphs: (1) scraping with the forelegs; (2) foreleg taps (tapping with the forelegs); (3) palpal taps (tapping with the maxillary palpi); and (4) tremulation (back-and-forth movement of the whole body). Scraping is hypothesized to be used for the inspection of borrows. Foreleg taps are possibly informing nearby individuals of their presence, because it is never observed in solitary conditions. Palpal taps are rarely observed and its function is unknown. Tremulation is possibly related to avoidance of conspecific individual approaching and touching. The combination of the four vibration behaviors in the mole cricket may be unique among insects.","Hayashi, Yaoko

"savedrecs (30).txt","Background
Rising-to-walk is an everyday transitional movement task rarely employed in gait rehabilitation. Sit-to-walk (STW) and sit-to-stand-and-walk (STSW), where a pause separates sit-to-stand and gait-initiation (GI) represent extremes of rising-to-walk behaviour. Delayed GI can indicate pathological impairment but is also observed in healthy individuals. We hypothesise that healthy subjects express consistent biomechanical parameters, among others that differ, during successful rising-to-walk task performance regardless of behaviour. This study therefore sought to identify if any parameters are consistent between STW and STSW in health because they represent normal rise-to-walk performance independent of pause, and also because they represent candidate parameters sensitive enough to monitor change in pathology.

Ten healthy volunteers performed 5 trials of STW and STSW. Event timing, ground-reaction-forces (GRFs), whole-body-centre-of-mass (BCoM) displacement, and centre-of-pressure (CoP) to extrapolated BCoM (xCoM) distance (indicator of positional stability) up to the 3rd step were compared between-tasks with paired t-tests. For consistent parameters; agreement between-tasks was assessed using Bland-Altman analyses and minimal-detectable-change (MDC) calculations.
Results
Mean vertical GRFs, peak forward momentum and fluidity during rising; CoP-xCoM separation at seat-off, upright, GI-onset, and steps1-2; and forward BCoM velocity were all significantly greater in STW. In contrast, peak BCoM vertical momentum, flexion-momentum time, and 3rd step stability were consistent between tasks and yielded acceptable reliability.
Conclusion
STW is a more challenging task due to the merging of rising with GI reflected by greater CoP-xCoM separation compared to STSW indicative of more positional instability. However, BCoM vertical momentum, flexion-momentum time, and step3 stability remained consistent in healthy individuals and are therefore candidates with which to monitor change in gait rehabilitation following pathology. Future studies should impose typical pause-durations observed in pathology upon healthy subjects to determine if the parameters we have identified remain consistent.","Jones, Gareth D.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Individual specialisations in animals are important contributors to a wide range of ecological and evolutionary processes, and have been particularly documented in relation to multiple aspects of foraging behaviours. Central-place foragers, such as seabirds, frequently exhibit pronounced specialisations and individual differences in a variety of foraging traits. In particular, the availability of fisheries discards alongside natural prey resources provides additional potential for differentiation and specialisation for opportunistically scavenging seabird species. However, the consequences of such specialisations for at-sea distributions and intraspecific interactions are not well known. Here, we investigated the links between the degree of dietary specialisation on natural or discarded prey and the foraging movements and spatial occupancy of northern gannets Morus bassanus in relation to differing intraspecific competition at 6 colonies of differing sizes. We found that, at most colonies, individuals with different dietary strategies concentrated foraging at differing levels of intraspecific competition. In addition, individuals pursuing different strategies were frequently, but not consistently, spatially separated, distinctions that were most acutely seen in females. However, this variation in individual strategy had no significant impact on current body condition. These analyses demonstrate how foraging-associated metrics need not covary within an unconstrained system. They also reveal that specialisation can have important consequences for the competitive regimes individuals experience, highlighting the complexity of examining interacting consequences at large spatial scales.","Bodey, Thomas W.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Fisheries science and fisheries management advice rely on both scientific and commercial data to estimate the distribution and abundance of marine species. These two data types differ, with scientific data having a broader geographical coverage but less intensity and time coverage compared to commercial data. Here we present a new type of commercial data with high resolution and coverage. To our knowledge, the dataset presented in this study has never been used for scientific purposes. While commercial datasets usually include the total weight by species on per haul basis, the new data also include the commercial size class for the species landed, recorded directly on a haul-by-haul basis. Thus, this dataset has the potential to provide knowledge on landed fish with as high spatio-temporal resolution as when coupling logbooks and sales slips but with the addition of detailed knowledge on the size distribution. Such information may otherwise be obtained through on-board observer programmes but unlike the observers' data, the dataset presented here is routinely collected on most of the trips of the vessels involved, which means that the coverage of the data for the individual vessel is larger than observers' data. Furthermore, the risk of changes in fishing behaviour due to the presence of an observer on-board is avoided. This paper describes the coverage and completeness of the dataset, and explores the reliability of the data available. We conclude that the main limitation is the small number of fishing vessels covered by the program, but that the data from those vessels are accurate, detailed, and relatively reliable.","Plet-Hansen, Kristian Schreiber

"savedrecs (30).txt","Background: Over the past decade, the miniaturisation of animal borne tags such as geolocators and GPS-transmitters has revolutionized our knowledge of the whereabouts of migratory species. Novel light-weight multi-sensor loggers (1.4 g), which harbour sensors for measuring ambient light intensity, atmospheric pressure, temperature and acceleration, were fixed to two long-distance migrant bird species -eurasian hoopoe (Upupa epops) and great reed warbler (Acrocephalus arundinaceus). Using acceleration and atmospheric pressure data recorded every 5 and 30 min, respectively, we aimed at reconstructing individual diurnal and seasonal patterns of flight activity and flight altitude and thereby, at describing basic, yet hitherto unknown characteristics of migratory flight behaviour. Furthermore, we wanted to characterise the variability in these migration characteristics between individuals, species and migration periods.
Results: The flight duration from breeding to sub-Saharan African non-breeding sites and back was more variable within than between the species. Great reed warblers were airborne for a total of 252 flight hours and thus, only slightly longer than eurasian hoopoes with 232 h. With a few exceptions, both species migrated predominantly nocturnally - departure around dusk and landing before dawn. Mean flight altitudes were higher during pre-than during post-breeding migration (median 1100 to 1600 m a.s.l.) and flight above 3000 m occurred regularly with a few great reed warblers exceeding 6000 m a.s.l. (max. 6458 m a.s.l.). Individuals changed flight altitudes repeatedly during a flight bout, indicating a continuous search for (more) favourable flight conditions.
Conclusions: We found high variation between individuals in the flight behaviour parameters measured - a variation that surprisingly even exceeded the variation between the species. More importantly, our results have shown that multi-sensor loggers have the potential to provide detailed insights into many fundamental aspects of individual behaviour in small aerial migrants. Combining the data recorded on the multiple sensors with, e.g., remote sensing data like weather and habitat quality on the spatial and temporal scale will be a great step forward to explore individual decisions during migration and their consequences.","Liechti, Felix

"savedrecs (30).txt","How animals integrate different sensory information for orientation is a complex process involving interactions between a variety of internal and external factors. Due to this complexity, each component of a suite of factors is typically studied in isolation. Here, we examine how an internal factor (personality of fish) influences the response of zebrafish (Danio rerio) to the magnetic field, while swimming in a flow chamber. Our previous work demonstrated that the orientation to the water current (rheotaxis) of zebrafish individuals is influenced by variations of the magnetic field only when fish are part of a shoal. In this study, we evaluated the rheotactic behavior of 20 fish, grouped in shoals of ""proactive"" or ""reactive"" individuals, under magnetic fields of different directions. We found that the magnetic field influenced at which water speed rheotaxis was elicited in zebrafish with ""reactive"" personality, but not in those with ""proactive"" personality. These results suggest that fish personality influences response to or weighing of sensory inputs and provides some insight on the variation in behavioral responses to environmental stimuli in both laboratory and natural settings.","Cresci, Alessandro

"savedrecs (30).txt","Scatter-hoarding rodents such as tree squirrels selectively cache seeds for subsequent use in widely-spaced caches placed below the ground surface. This behavior has important implications for seed dispersal, seedling establishment, and tree regeneration. Hoarders manage these caches by recovering and eating some seeds, and moving and re-caching others. This process of re-caching, however, is poorly understood. Here, we use radiotelemetry to evaluate re-caching behavior for the management of acorn caches by rodents in eastern deciduous forests. We also test the hypothesis that as seeds are re-cached, the distance from the source increases. Radio transmitters were implanted in Northern red oak (Quercus rubra) acorns and presented to rodents in a natural setting over 3 seasons. We used radio-telemetry to track and document evidence of recovery and re-caching. We tracked a total of 102 acorns. Of the 39 radio-tagged acorns initially cached, 19 (49%) were cached on two or more occasions; one acorn was cached four times. The hypothesis that rodents move seeds to progressively greater distances from the source is not well-supported, suggesting that acorns are being moved within an individual's home range. Given the species of rodents in the study area, gray squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) are the most likely to be responsible for the caching and re-caching events. Gray squirrels appear to engage in extensive re-caching during periods of long-term food storage, which has important implications for understanding how caching behavior influences acorn dispersal and oak regeneration.","Bartlow, Andrew W.

The expanding abundance and distribution of feral hogs throughout North America is testimony to their ability to adapt to differing environmental and habitat conditions. We evaluated movements and activity of 18 feral hogs fitted with Global Positioning System (GPS) collars between March 2015 through July 2017 in the Texas Panhandle, USA, following three toxicant field studies. We investigated movements of feral hogs in response to individual, weather, and environmental variables using generalized linear mixed models. Nocturnal and diurnal 3 h movements were 753.8 +/- 14.28 m and 277.45 +/- 8.04 m for all hogs, respectively. Overall mean distance (+/- SE) traveled by feral hogs was 3666.9 +/- 64.7 m per day (range: 7.9 to 12985.33 m). Daily distance by males and females averaged 3903.6 +/- 112.05 m and 3546.1 +/- 78.88 m, respectively, and were not found to be significantly different between sexes. Behavior of feral hogs showed a unimodal pattern, peaking during nocturnal hours. Time of day, land cover type, and temperature were important explanatory variables driving 3 h movements. Sex, temperature, and previous day precipitation were important explanatory variables driving daily distances. Predicting what drives hog movement (e.g., individual and external factors) can allow managers to identify when and where to locate individuals for control efforts, possibly preventing initial invasions by feral hogs.","Franckowiak, Gregory A.

We used GPS data to quantify the movement patterns of elephant bulls, buffalo and cattle at multiple scales and according to seasonal changes of surface water availability. Cattle, elephant and buffalo prefer open grassland habitats found close to water but elephant and buffalo avoid cattle differently. During the rainy season, cattle enter the protected area daily; buffalo avoid cattle completely at the home range scale, whereas elephant bulls avoid cattle at finer scales by favoring temporal niche shift. Elephant bulls avoid direct encounters with cattle (or people) during the day but come closer to the boundary and to water at night when cattle are kept in enclosures close to the homesteads. During the dry season, when cattle range further into the protected area in search of forage, buffalo and cattle spatial overlap increases as water dependence takes precedence over avoidance. Elephant bulls range closer to the boundary at night and increase the number of excursions into the Communal Area. Cattle herding creates a buffer zone between wildlife areas and human settlements because wild herbivores strongly avoid livestock and people. However, avoidance only lasts as long as resources are abundant. Our study suggests that long-term planning of both artificial water provisioning and traditional cattle herding practices could help maintaining spatial segregation and thus mitigate conservation conflicts such as pathogen transmission, crop raiding or livestock depredation.","Valls-Fox, H.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Driven by the availability of food subsidies and landscape transformation, large carnivore populations are increasingly inhabiting the vicinity of humans. To persist in human proximity, while avoiding conflict and mortality, they must make adjustments in their spatial behavior. Understanding such behavioral adaptations can be crucial to formulate conservation strategies. We used GPS location data to study the movement and space use of protected Arabian wolves in the extremely arid Negev Desert (Israel), where natural prey densities are reduced. We examined wolf preference for the proximity of human infrastructure, while testing the hypothesis that wolves would use areas where ungulates were more likely to occur. Wolves showed a strong spatial association with humans, spending a large proportion of their time in proximity of human infrastructure and moving primarily along roads. Wolves also increased their movement during the night. In addition, wolves that had higher availability of human infrastructure in their home ranges showed increased selection for such features, suggesting a positive functional response. Finally, wolves did not show preference for areas of high ungulate occurrence at either spatial scale. These findings, combined with recent diet analyses, indicate that wolves rely on human subsidies, proportioned by the availability of garbage and agricultural produce. Our results demonstrate that wolves fine-tune their space use to persist in the vicinity of humans. Additional conditions that enable such persistence include effective legal protection and positive local attitudes toward wolves. We conclude that such circumstances can promote spatial coexistence of humans and large carnivores. The strong observed spatial association and evident dietary dependence of wolves on subsidies from a low-density human population may also reflect the conditions that led to dog domestication.","Barocas, A.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Sensor-based technologies are becoming increasingly available and can be used to automatically gather long-term data about animal behaviour. With this information, it is possible to assess the circadian rhythm of activity and monitor its response to internal and external factors. Identifying irregularities in this rhythm may indicate animal health and welfare issues. The aim of this study was to collect sensor-based general activity and investigate circadian rhythm of this activity to identify the changes due to weather influences that act on these parameters throughout the year; to identify the differences between individuals; and to assess links between general activity and circadian rhythm of activity with sheep body weight change. In total, 29 Scottish Blackface ewes of different ages and body condition scores were used. The animals were monitored for four consecutive weeks in each of four seasonal periods, in extensive systems on Scottish upland pastures, and without human handling during study periods. Accelerometer-integrated collars were fitted to the animals to collect motion index continuously every minute. These data were used to calculate the percentage of cyclic behaviour that was harmonic/synchronized with the environment (over 24 h period), as Degree of Functional Coupling (DFC). The DFC was shown within rolling seven-day periods. Low DFCs indicate low synchronization. Weather data were collected daily. Random regression models were used to assess between-individual variation. During the winter period, the level of the DFC for the activity of nineteen ewes lowered in response to a period of high level of precipitation combined with low winter temperatures. However, four ewes exhibited a lower level of variation in the DFC values, showing that there were differences between individuals in regard to their response to the precipitation level. The overall mean of the DFC for the general activity was highest in autumn (95.4%, P < 0.001), however, it did not differ between summer and spring (respectively 90.2% and 88.1%, P > 0.05), but was significantly lower during the winter (81.7%, P < 0.001) compared with summer and autumn. Over the spring and summer, variation in DFC was a good estimator of body weight gain. It was concluded that the assessment of circadian rhythms of general activity using the DFC-parameter allows a better understanding of sheep responses to weather influences, compared to the evaluation of general activity alone. The random regression model method was effective in identifying animals that deviated positively or negatively from population responses.","Sarout, Bruna Nunes Marsiglio

"savedrecs (30).txt","In 1997, Eurasian Eagle Owls Bubo bubo returned to Limburg, the south-eastern province of The Netherlands. However, since then the population size has stagnated, while extremely high concentrations of PCBs have been found in Eagle Owl carcasses. These observations suggest that a further expansion of the species in Limburg is under threat. The high concentrations of toxic substances may be explained by the Eagle Owls' position at the top of the food chain. Studying their hunting behaviour may help to identify possible sources of poisoning. Identifying the most important habitat characteristics of hunting grounds is a first step towards recognizing poisoning sources. For this purpose, and to gain general insight into their habitat use, a GPS tracking study was conducted on six adult Eagle Owls from three adjoining territories in 2010-2011. We found that the quarries in the region are important for the Eagle Owls since they are used as nesting sites. Other habitat characteristics that attract the species are pastures, differences in altitude, forest edges and water bodies. Major roads and town centres are avoided. The highlighted areas and habitat characteristics provide information about the most important hunting habitats of Eagle Owls and insight into the underlying causes threatening this species in Limburg.","Van Nieuland, Steffie

"savedrecs (30).txt","In 2007, the first miniature light-level geolocators were deployed on small landbirds, revolutionizing the study of migration. In this paper, we review studies that have used geolocators to track small landbirds with the goal of summarizing research themes and identifying remaining important gaps in understanding. We also highlight research and opportunities using 2 recently developed tracking technologies: archival GPS tags and automated radio-telemetry systems. In our review, we found that most (54%) geolocator studies focused on quantifying natural history of migration, such as identifying migration routes, nonbreeding range, and migration timing. Studies of behavioral ecology (20%) uncovered proximate drivers of movements, including en route habitat quality; that migration routes, but not timing, may be flexible in some species; and different age and sex classes show significant differences in migration strategy. Studies of the evolution of migration (9%) have illustrated that migration is a potential barrier to hybridizing species or subspecies, and some work has correlated gene polymorphisms and methylation patterns with migration behavior. Studies of migratory connectivity (11%) have shown that a moderate level of connectivity is common, although variability across and within species exists. Studies of seasonal interactions (7%) have found mixed results: in some cases, carryover effects have been identified; in other cases, carryover effects are buffered during intervening stages of the annual cycle. Archival GPS tags provide unprecedented precision in locations of nonbreeding sites and migration routes, and will continue to improve understanding of migration across large spatial scales. Automated radio-telemetry systems are revolutionizing our knowledge of migratory stopover biology, and have led to discoveries of previously unknown stopover behaviors. Together, these tracking technologies will continue to provide insight into small migratory landbird movements and contribute important information for conservation of this rapidly declining group.","McKinnon, Emily A.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Partial migration-a strategy in which some individuals are resident and others are migratory within the same population-is widespread among avian species and could play an important transitional role in the evolution of migratory behavior. Nevertheless, detailed movement data are unavailable for most partial migrant species. We examined migration strategies of the American Crow (Corvus brachyrhynchos), a partially migratory species that overwinters in large communal roosts, from which some birds migrate north to breed. We used a combination of satellite telemetry, isotopic signatures (delta H-2), and molecular markers (33 microsatellites) to describe and characterize the migratory movements of individuals from overwintering roosts on the east coast (Utica, New York) and west coast (Davis, California) of the United States. We collected 11,951 data points from 18 satellite-tagged individuals between 2014 and 2018, among which 14 (77.8%) were migratory (8 of 11 and 6 of 7 birds on the west and east coasts, respectively). Migration distances were 280-1,095 km and 177-793 km on the west and east coasts, respectively. Individual birds were consistent in their migratory behavior across years, and breeding-site fidelity was high: both migratory and resident birds returned to the same location in the breeding season of each year. Both isotopic signatures and molecular markers could generally differentiate residents from long-distance migrants (i.e. those breeding at latitudes > 3.5 degrees N of the resident populations), but they did not consistently differentiate residents from migrants with shorter migration distances. Overall, these data on the migratory movements of American Crows and the proportion of migrants in their roosts can serve as a baseline against which to test predictions about how partial migrants will respond to environmental alterations such as climate change and urbanization.","Townsend, Andrea K.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Deep-diving sperm whales have a complex social structure and the largest brain of any animal, but very little is known about the ontogeny of their diving, foraging, echolocation, and communication skills. In large-brained terrestrial species, social skills develop earlier than locomotor abilities, but this may not be feasible for sperm whales, which require locomotor skills from birth to breathe, swim, and suckle. Here, we shed new light on the relative development of social and locomotor capabilities of a wild toothed whale. Sound and movement recording tags deployed on three first-year sperm whale calves for a total of 15h revealed that these calves rarely produced codas for communication with adult whales, but likely tracked the ample passive acoustic cues emitted by clicking adults. The calves' diving capabilities were well developed (maximum dive depth: 285, 337, and 662m; maximum dive time: 11, 31, and 44min) and they all produced clicks in a way that is consistent with echolocation. The calf performing the longest and deepest dives additionally emitted two echolocation buzzes, suggesting that it could haveattempted to forage. Thus, sperm whale calves may supplement their milk diet with food caught independently at depth much earlier than previously believed. Contrary to terrestrial mammals, we propose that the maturation of locomotor, diving, and echolocation skills may be favored over investment in developing social communication skills at an early age in sperm whales.Significance statementThe life of deep-diving toothed whales has up until recently been a mystery and the understanding of their behavior has generally been limited to surface observations and captive studies. Fortunately, the rapid development of animal-borne bio-logging devices has markedly improved our knowledge of the behavior of adult whales. The behavior and development of young calves are, however, still largely unknown. Sperm whale calves are challenged by being air-breathing marine mammals, which must learn to hunt prey at great depths. Using Dtags, we here show that sperm whale calves have much more pronounced diving capabilities than previously thought. The onset of independent foraging and foraging effort seems linked to the diving capability of the calf. These results show that young members of this otherwise slowly maturing species of apex predators do learn to dive and may hunt much earlier than previously believed.","Tonnesen, Pernille

"savedrecs (30).txt","Landscape conversion to agriculture is the primary cause for habitat loss worldwide. As partial mitigation, agricultural landscapes may be designated as ecological corridors due to their presumed habitability and permeability to wildlife. Behavioral changes following anthropogenic disturbance can affect species' spatio-temporal activity patterns and modify interactions, and thus influence habitat preferences. Understanding how human activity affects wildlife behavior and how such behavioral changes scale up to the community may enhance the effectiveness of conservation schemes. We used camera traps to measure the activity of five mammal species along a disturbance gradient in an agricultural -natural mosaic landscape designated as a national ecological corridor. Wildlife diurnal activity was minimal around towns, where humans were active during the day. Nevertheless, predator activity increased near towns and at other sites of high disturbance. Although attracted to highly disturbed areas, predators avoided humans temporally by restricting activity to night-time, whereas prey activity relative to less disturbed areas was negligible. We conclude that perceived threat from humans during daytime combined with elevated nocturnal predation risk exclude prey species from large areas of an agricultural region designated as ecological corridor. Human activity may have triggered a cascading effect mediated by predators' diel activity shifts, which reduced landscape permeability to prey.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Large carnivores can exert strong influence on local ecosystems, making them important targets for biodiversity conservation. An important question for conserving large carnivores outside of protected areas is the role of human activity in influencing the behavior of these predators. We used high-resolution animal location tracking and statistical modeling to examine the behavior of seven leopards (Panthera pardus) occupying an area that includes a research center and livestock ranch in central Kenya. Our analyses reveal changes in habitat selection around the times of sunrise and sunset, corresponding with changes in human activity at our site. Activity patterns were also variable within and among the leopards in our sample. To explore sources of this variability, we used regression modeling to estimate the relative influence of changing spatial and environmental conditions for leopard ranging behavior. Despite the tendency to be active during the day, we found that leopards strongly avoided areas where they were likely to encounter people during the daytime and showed variable selection for these same areas at night. The use of anthropogenic habitats was also associated with periods of greater ranging activity. We discuss the implications of these results for conservation efforts that attempt to balance the demands of livestock ranching alongside carnivore conservation.","Van Cleave, Eric K.

"savedrecs (30).txt","To meet the expanding land use required for wind energy development, a better understanding of the effects on terrestrial animals' responses to such development is required. Using GPS-data from 50 freely ranging female reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) in the Mala reindeer herding community, Sweden, we determined reindeer calving sites and estimated reindeer habitat selection using resource selection functions (RSF). RSFs were estimated at both second- (selection of home range) and third-order (selection within home range) scale in relation to environmental variables, wind farm (WF) development phase (before construction, construction, and operation), distance to the WFs and at the second-order scale whether the wind turbines were in or out of sight of the reindeer. We found that the distance between reindeer calving site and WFs increased during the operation phase, compared to before construction. At both scales of selection, we found a significant decrease in habitat selection of areas in proximity of the WFs, in the same comparison. The results also revealed a shift in home range selection away from habitats where wind turbines became visible toward habitats where the wind turbines were obscured by topography (increase in use by 79% at 5km). We interpret the reindeer shift in home range selection as an effect of the wind turbines per se. Using topography and land cover information together with the positions of wind turbines could therefore help identify sensitive habitats for reindeer and improve the planning and placement of WFs. In addition, we found that operation phase of these WFs had a stronger adverse impact on reindeer habitat selection than the construction phase. Thus, the continuous running of the wind turbines making a sound both day and night seemed to have disturbed the reindeer more than the sudden sounds and increased human activity during construction work.","Skarin, Anna

"savedrecs (30).txt","Marine mammal depredation on fisheries (animals removing fish caught on fishing gear) is a worldwide issue involving socio-economic and ecological consequences. Longline fisheries are the most impacted by odontocete (toothed whales) depredation. While technological means have provided limited efficacy in reducing depredation, this study examined the fishing practices influencing both the proportion of depredated longline sets and the amount of fish removed by whales. We used an 8-year dataset from the Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) longline fisheries operating in Crozet and Kerguelen Economic Exclusive Zones (EEZs) (South Indian Ocean) and GLMMs to investigate sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus) depredation. Sperm whale depredation occurred on 61% of 5260 sets in Crozet and 41% of 16,902 sets in Kerguelen, and resulted in minimum estimated toothfish losses of 702 tons and 2649 tons, respectively, in the two areas. The probability of depredation decreased in winter months, increased with depth fished and decreased when vessels travelled over distances of > 60 km from fishing grounds with encountering depredation. These findings suggest the natural spatiotemporal distribution of sperm whales and their ability to follow vessels over limited ranges influence the number of captured fish removals. The amount of depredated toothfish decreased with the speed at which longline sets were hauled and increased with the soaking time of sets suggesting that whales may depredate sets during both hauling and soaking operations. Together, these observations indicate that rates of depredation may be influenced by the conditions of fishing operations and could therefore be employed to implement strategies of avoidance in all fisheries facing similar depredation impacts.","Janc, Anais

"savedrecs (30).txt","Steelhead, the anadromous form of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), is one of the most coveted recreationally targeted salmonids worldwide, and catch-and-release (C&R) is commonly used as a conservation strategy to protect wild stocks. Nevertheless, little research has examined how wild steelhead respond to capture and handling. During a summer-run recreational fishery on the Bulkley River in British Columbia, we used nonlethal blood sampling and radio telemetry to assess the physiological stress response, post-release behaviour, and survival of wild steelhead exposed to either 0 s, 10 s, or 30 s of air exposure, over a range of water temperatures, fight times, and landing methods. Steelhead that were air exposed following landing had greater reflex impairment and moved further downstream immediately following release than fish kept in the water, though there was no observed difference in movement two weeks after capture. Overall, angled fish had significantly greater blood lactate levels than baseline levels (obtained from a subsample of fish dip netted from the river) suggesting a general stress response to angling and handling. Regardless of air exposure treatment, water temperature was positively associated with blood lactate and negatively associated with blood pH. Other variables such as fish body size (mm) and fight time (s) had little influence on any of the physiological or behavioural variables. Estimated 3-day survival of steelhead was 95.5%, with deep-hooking as the primary source of mortality. Overwinter mortality of caught-and-released fish was estimated at 10.5%, with an estimated total pre-spawn mortality of 15.0%. This study is the first to evaluate the factors that influence C&R outcomes in wild steelhead in a recreational fishery. Findings suggest that steelhead anglers should limit air exposure to less than 10 s, and that anglers should be cautious (minimize handling and air exposure) when water temperatures are warmer.","Twardek, W.

"savedrecs (30).txt","From butterflies to elephants, the rapidly developing science of movement ecology is providing increasingly detailed spatio-temporal data on a wide array of mobile animals. Thus, this discipline also holds great promise for improving the conservation of wildlife. To measure progress toward this promise, we investigated the degree to which movement ecology research is connected to conservation goals as well as the proportion of studies that were incorporated into federal and international status assessments for mobile species at risk. We examined 13,349 ""movement ecology"" papers published between 1990 and 2014 and found that explicit connections to conservation and management were made in 35% (n = 4, 672) of these papers, with the number of connections increasing over time. We then measured the uptake of movement ecology research into species status assessment and recovery plans (n = 72 documents) produced by three different governance agencies for 12 endangered mobile species. We found that on average 60% of available movement ecology research was used in the status assessment process, demonstrating that when movement ecology research is available, it is generally being utilized in conservation planning. However, for 25% of these species, there was little movement research available to be used, highlighting that knowledge gaps remain for some at-risk species despite the general growth of movement ecology research. We outline opportunities for movement ecology to promote more effective conservation of taxa that move.","Fraser, Kevin C.

"savedrecs (30).txt","This study identified how the manipulation in the number of goal targets affects the tactical behaviour of players from different age groups (U9, U11, U15 and U17). Forty youth futsal players performed two small-sided games based on Gk + 4vs4 + Gk situation with one regular and two small targets. TACTO software was used to capture players and ball displacements. The following variables were computed and presented as absolute values, coefficient of variation and regularity (approximate entropy): (i) distance from each player to the team centre (DtC); (ii) distance from each player to the ball (DtB); (iii) distance between team centres (DbTC); and (iv) distance from team centre to the ball (DCtB). The team dispersion increased with two goal targets (mainly the DbTC, U9 and U17, large effects; U11 and U15, very large effects). Also, the use of two goal targets condition increased the variability in the DbTC (U9, small effects; U11 and U15 moderate effects; U17, very large effects) and DCtB (U9 and U17 moderate effects and U11 and U15 small effects). Overall, the approximate entropy values showed higher regularity in the condition with two targets. All age groups were sensitive to the manipulation of goal targets, however, the U9 were the most sensitive to the changes, as seen by the dispersion of players in the field. Thus, coaches can use one target to promote movement irregularity of players and two targets to increase the team dispersion, mainly in younger age groups that tend to be agglomerated around the ball.","Travassos, Bruno

"savedrecs (30).txt","The isochrony principle is a well-known phenomenon whereby the speed of human arm movement is regulated to increase as its trajectory distance increases. However, the relationship between the trajectory planning and the isochrony phenomenon has never been sufficiently explained. One computational study derived the algorithm for estimating the optimal movement segmentation and its duration based on the framework of the minimum commanded torque change criterion. By extending this finding, we can consider the hypothesis that the human arm trajectory is generated based on the minimum commanded torque change criterion to ensure that the duration average of the commanded torque changes (DCTCs) are equivalent between certain movement segmentations, rather than to satisfy the isochrony phenomenon. To test this hypothesis, we measured the behavioral performance of hand movement tasks in which subjects write eight-shaped and double-elliptical-shaped trajectories including two similar shaped arcs of different sizes (hereafter called large and small loops). Our results indicate that the human arm movement is planned in such a manner that the DCTCs for the large and small loops are equivalent during writing of the double-elliptical-shaped trajectories regardless of the arc size. A similar tendency was also observed for the data during the eight-shaped movements, although the ratio of the DCTCs slightly changed depending on the arc size conditions. Thus, our study provides experimental evidence that the isochrony phenomenon is ensured through the computational process of trajectory planning.","Yokoyama, Hiroshi

"savedrecs (30).txt","Successful sports performance requires athletes to be able to mediate any detrimental effects of anxiety whilst being able to complete tasks simultaneously. In this study, we examine how skill level influences the ability to mediate the effects of anxiety on anticipation performance and the capacity to allocate attentional resources to concurrent tasks. We use a counterbalanced, repeated measures design that required expert and novice badminton players to complete a film based anticipation test in which they predicted serve direction under high- and low-anxiety conditions. On selected trials, participants completed an auditory secondary task. Visual search data were recorded and the Mental Readiness Form v-3 was used to measure cognitive anxiety, somatic anxiety and self-confidence. The Rating Scale of Mental Effort was used to measure mental effort. The expert players outperformed their novice counterparts on the anticipation task across both anxiety conditions, with both groups anticipation performance deteriorating under high-compared to low-anxiety. This decrease across anxiety conditions was significantly greater in the novice compared to the expert group. High-anxiety resulted in a shorter final visual fixation duration for both groups when compared to low-anxiety. Anxiety had a negative impact on secondary task performance for the novice, but not the expert group. Our findings suggest that expert athletes more effectively allocated attentional resources during performance under high anxiety conditions. In contrast, novice athletes used more attentional resources when completing the primary task and, therefore, were unable to maintain secondary task performance under high anxiety.","Alder, D. B.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Humans use a stereotypical movement pattern to grasp a target object. What is the cause of this stereotypical pattern? One of the possible factors is that the target object is considered an obstacle at positions other than the envisioned goal positions for the digits: while each digit aims for a goal position on the target object, they avoid other positions on the target object even if these positions do not obstruct the movement. According to this hypothesis, the maximum grip aperture will be higher if the risk of colliding with the target object is larger. Based on this hypothesis, we made a set of two unique predictions for grasping a vertically oriented cuboid at its sides at different heights. For cuboids of the same height, the maximum grip aperture will be smaller when grasped higher. For cuboids whose height varies with grip height, the maximum grip aperture will be larger when grasped higher. Both predicted relations were experimentally confirmed. This result supports the idea that considering the target object as an obstacle at positions other than the envisioned goal positions for the digits is underlying the stereotypical movement patterns in grasping. The goal positions of the digits thus influence the maximum grip aperture even if the distance between the goal positions on the target object does not change.","Verheij, Rebekka

"savedrecs (30).txt","Vestibular information plays an important role in spatially oriented motor control and perception. With regard to reorienting head movements, little is known of (1) how vestibular mechanisms compensate for disturbances from concurrent passive trunk rotations (e.g. in a veering vehicle), and (2) whether and how this disturbance compensation is related to the perception of body orientation in space. We here address these two questions in a single experiment.
Six healthy subjects (Ss) seated on a turning chair in darkness performed two tasks. (1) Head pointing. Ss made swift head movements in darkness towards the angular position in space of a previously shown visual target. These movements were disturbed by concurrent rotations of the chair, and hence the trunk, which were driven by scaled down versions of the Ss' own head-on-trunk rotations. Although unaware of the disturbance, Ss adjusted their head movements so as to attenuate its effect on head-in-space (HS) position by about 45%. (2) Visual straight ahead (VSA): Using a light pointer, Ss indicated their VSA before each head-pointing trial and tried to reproduce it after the trial. In all Ss, VSA accounted for the disturbing trunk rotation, although to individually varying degrees. No correlation could be detected between VSA reproduction and motor performance, neither within nor across subjects. A vestibular loss subject who performed the same two tasks made no compensatory movements during head pointing and did not account for the disturbance of his HS position during VSA reproduction.
Three concepts of vestibular information processing for head movement control were explored with regard to their compatibility with the head-pointing results: (1) Conventional negative feedback, (2) Interaction with an efference copy, and (3) Interaction with neck proprioceptive information. Theoretical analyses and model simulations indicated that all three concepts can explain the observed disturbance compensation. However, they differ in terms of control stability in the presence of feedback time delays, with (3) being best and (1) worst. The different concepts might correspond to fast simple and slower complex compensation mechanisms, respectively, and possibly complement each other during natural behaviours. VSA reproduction may be based on analogous processing principles, but appears to involve different neural circuitries.","Becker, W.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Pair bonds are considered important for successful breeding in monogamous birds but their maintenance may be challenging for migratory species, as mates can be separated for months during the non-breeding period. To investigate whether mates of monogamous migratory seabirds stay together throughout the non-breeding period and how and when they start synchronizing their activity before breeding, we tracked seven pairs and 22 individuals of Rhinoceros Auklets Cerorhinca monocerata with geolocators and saltwater immersion loggers. Mates migrated across similar areas during the non-breeding period but with a sustained temporal shift, putting them an average of 377km apart and resulting in an average difference of return date at the colony of 5.6days, with no sex biases. These values did not differ significantly from those between pairs' of randomly selected, non-mated birds. Mates showed synchronized on-water/in-air at-sea activities once both birds returned and spent the first night together at the colony. The synchronization of activities was highest on the day following the nights when both mates visited the colony, and decreased with elapsed time. Mates then left the colony together for a pre-laying exodus of 8-9days and males returned 2-4days earlier than females before incubation started. Mates kept synchronizing at-sea activity during the early part of the exodus. We interpret this as the mates staying together at sea during the pre-laying period, increasing the males' chances of copulation at sea. The patterns of mate association observed in Rhinoceros Auklets contrast with those of the Procellariiformes, presumably reflecting differences in the place and timing of copulation.","Kubo, Aina

"savedrecs (30).txt","Animals originated and evolved during a unique time in Earth history-the Neoproterozoic Era. This paper aims to discuss (1) when landmark events in early animal evolution occurred, and (2) the environmental context of these evolutionary milestones, and how such factors may have affected ecosystems and body plans. With respect to timing, molecular clock studies-utilizing a diversity of methodologies-agree that animal multicellularity had arisen by similar to 800 million years ago (Ma) (Tonian period), the bilaterian body plan by similar to 650 Ma (Cryogenian), and divergences between sister phyla occurred similar to 560-540 Ma (late Ediacaran). Most purported Tonian and Cryogenian animal body fossils are unlikely to be correctly identified, but independent support for the presence of pre-Ediacaran animals is recorded by organic geochemical biomarkers produced by demosponges. This view of animal origins contrasts with data from the fossil record, and the taphonomic question of why animals were not preserved (if present) remains unresolved. Neoproterozoic environments demanding small, thin, body plans, and lower abundance/rarity in populations may have played a role. Considering environmental conditions, geochemical data suggest that animals evolved in a relatively lowoxygen ocean. Here, we present new analyses of sedimentary total organic carbon contents in shales suggesting that the Neoproterozoic ocean may also have had lower primary productivity-or at least lower quantities of organic carbon reaching the seafloor-compared with the Phanerozoic. Indeed, recent modeling efforts suggest that low primary productivity is an expected corollary of a low-O-2 world. Combined with an inability to inhabit productive regions in a low-O-2 ocean, earliest animal communities would likely have been more food limited than generally appreciated, impacting both ecosystem structure and organismal behavior. In light of this, we propose the ""fire triangle"" metaphor for environmental influences on early animal evolution. Moving toward consideration of all environmental aspects of the Cambrian radiation (fuel, heat, and oxidant) will ultimately lead to a more holistic view of the event.","Sperling, Erik A.

"savedrecs (30).txt","The development of migratory behaviour is a continuous process which is not only determined by genes, but also moulded by individual differences based on life-history variations occurring at each ontogenetic stage. Assessing consistency and plasticity in migratory traits between long distance (LDM) and short distance migratory (SDM) populations within the same species that may express dissimilarities in the leeway of annual schedules is essential to understand the evolution and ontogeny of migratory strategies. We studied the migration strategies in autumn regarding flight speed and the use of stopovers (number and duration of stop-overs across the whole journey) at the intra-specific level, by tracking with GPS loggers the intercontinental migration of 43 adult and juvenile ospreys Pandion haliaetus from both LDM and SDM populations. LDM ospreys travelled distances five times larger than SDM ospreys, but their total migration speed was 2.4 times slower. While daily distance travelled did not differ between populations, the reduced total migration speed by LDMs was due to higher stopover use compared to SDM birds. SDM birds used more direct routes, crossing open sea at higher flight speeds, even though both populations largely benefitted from wind assistance across their journey. Across populations, adult birds travelled longer distances per day and displayed less sinuous migratory paths than juveniles, suggesting that migratory capabilities improve with age and experience of the bird. Overall, the time constraint related to total migration distance was not the main driver of the total migration speed, and other factors such as physiological needs to rest and refuel at stopover sites may play an important role. Our study underlines the importance of investigating variability in migration strategies in partially migratory species, for a better understanding of avian migratory ecology.","Monti, Flavio

"savedrecs (30).txt","Reproductive activities can incur various costs to breeding individuals in birds. One cost is that reproduction decreases survival probabilities of attendant individuals, which may have a major effect on population demography. During brood rearing, adults of precocial species usually make extensive movements to lead their young to sites with adequate food resources and dense cover. However, few studies have evaluated the effects of brood movement on attendant precocial adults. In this study, we tracked female Chinese Grouse during brood-rearing periods using radiotelemetry at Lianhuashan Nature Reserve, Gansu, China, during 2010-2012, to evaluate the effects of brood rearing and movement distances on females' survival probabilities using known fate models in program MARK. All 41 females attempted to breed, and 30 females successfully hatched at least one chick; 11 failed during the incubation period. Although females with broods moved more extensively than females without broods, movement distances did not influence survival probabilities of attendant females. Seven females with broods were killed by predators, resulting in a lower survival probability (0.958 +/- 0.016 weekly survival and 0.679 +/- 0.099 through the 9-weeks brood-rearing periods) than for females without broods, which all survived the brood-rearing periods. Our results agree with the prediction of life history theory, which assumes that cost must correlate with reproduction. The extensive movement patterns found in this study might reflect a lack of suitable brood-rearing habitat near nest sites, which might be detrimental to chick survival and influence the persistence of this population.","Zhao, Jin-Ming

"savedrecs (30).txt","When aiming to capture a fast-moving target, animals can follow it until they catch up, or try to intercept it. In principle, interception is the more complicated strategy, but also more energy efficient. To study whether simple feedback controllers can explain interception behaviours by animals with miniature brains, we have reconstructed and studied the predatory flights of the robber fly Holcocephala fusca and killer fly Coenosia attenuata. Although both species catch other aerial arthropods out of the air, Holcocephala contrasts prey against the open sky, while Coenosia hunts against clutter and at much closer range. Thus, their solutions to this target catching task may differ significantly. We reconstructed in three dimensions the flight trajectories of these two species and those of the presented targets they were attempting to intercept. We then tested their recorded performances against simulations. We found that both species intercept targets on near time-optimal courses. To investigate the guidance laws that could underlie this behaviour, we tested three alternative control systems (pure pursuit, deviated pursuit and proportional navigation). Only proportional navigation explains the timing and magnitude of fly steering responses, but with differing gain constants and delays for each fly species. Holcocephala uses a dimensionless navigational constant of N approximate to 3 with a time delay of approximate to 28 ms to intercept targets over a comparatively long range. This constant is optimal, as it minimizes the control effort required to hit the target. In contrast, Coenosia uses a constant of N approximate to 1.5 with a time delay of approximate to 18 ms, this setting may allow Coenosia to cope with the extremely high line-of-sight rotation rates, which are due to close target proximity, and thus prevent overcompensation of steering. This is the first clear evidence of interception supported by proportional navigation in insects. This work also demonstrates how by setting different gains and delays, the same simple feedback controller can yield the necessary performance in two different environments.","Fabian, Samuel T.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Tracking the movements of birds in three dimensions is integral to a wide range of problems in animal ecology, behaviour and cognition. Multi-camera stereo-imaging has been used to track the three-dimensional (3D) motion of birds in dense flocks, but precise localization of birds remains a challenge due to imaging resolution in the depth direction and optical occlusion. This paper introduces a portable stereo-imaging system with improved accuracy and a simple stereo-matching algorithm that can resolve optical occlusion. This system allows us to decouple body and wing motion, and thus measure not only velocities and accelerations but also wingbeat frequencies along the 3D trajectories of birds. We demonstrate these new methods by analysing six flocking events consisting of 50 to 360 jackdaws (Corvus monedula) and rooks (Corvus frugilegus) as well as 32 jackdaws and 6 rooks flying in isolated pairs or alone. Our method allows us to (i) measure flight speed and wingbeat frequency in different flying modes; (ii) characterize the U-shaped flight performance curve of birds in the wild, showing that wingbeat frequency reaches its minimum at moderate flight speeds; (iii) examine group effects on individual flight performance, showing that birds have a higher wingbeat frequency when flying in a group than when flying alone and when flying in dense regions than when flying in sparse regions; and (iv) provide a potential avenue for automated discrimination of bird species. We argue that the experimental method developed in this paper opens new opportunities for understanding flight kinematics and collective behaviour in natural environments.","Ling, Hangjian

"savedrecs (30).txt","Environmental factors have strong influence on activity of alpine ungulates. However, the presence and activities of people in high mountains have been growing rapidly and have led to the advent of human-induced factors, which may modify the time budget. In this study, we examined the influence of natural and human-induced factors on the daytime budget of Tatra chamois Rupicapra rupicapra tatrica. On average, chamois spent 46% of their time foraging, 40% resting, 13% moving around and 1% on social behaviour. The amount of time devoted to particular categories of behaviour was influenced by the time of day, herd size, weather conditions and human disturbance. Human disturbance and the time of day had the highest effect on the proportion of foraging in the daytime budget, which increased as the day progressed and at greater distances from the nearest hiking trail. These two factors also increased the amount of time spent resting, which peaked during the afternoon hours and at greater distances from the nearest trail. The time spent moving around decreased with increasing herd size, distance from the nearest trail and as the day progressed. Males devoted less time to foraging and more to resting and moving around than females. The intensity of human-induced factors is particularly important for a population inhabiting a small, isolated area, as is the case with strictly high-mountain species.","Peksa, Lukasz

"savedrecs (30).txt","Generalist and opportunistic species, such as the yellow-legged gull Larus michahellis, can feed on a wide variety of food from both marine and terrestrial origins. This work evaluates the potential foraging strategies (terrestrial, mix and marine) of the yellow-legged gull during the breeding season, in Berlenga (39 degrees 24'55 '' N, 9 degrees 30'28 '' W) and Deserta (36 degrees 57'45 '' N, 7 degrees 53'29 '' W) Islands, Portugal, across 2011-2016. Stable isotope analyses (delta C-13 and delta N-15) of plasma and blood cells were performed to estimate the proportion of individuals pursuing each strategy based on discrimination analyses. For that, GPS loggers were used to assess individual foraging destinations. Overall, this study discriminated well the foraging strategies adopted by gulls through stable isotope analyses (estimated error of 16.7%). Results indicated a variation in foraging strategies across years and between colonies. As expected, this variation was influenced by oceanographic conditions and availability of marine food sources nearby the colonies. The isotopic niche of yellow-legged gulls pursuing a marine strategy was much smaller than the niche of gulls with a terrestrial strategy, but surprisingly only slight smaller than the niche of gulls pursuing a mixed strategy. Gulls adopting a terrestrial strategy fed on a wide variety of foods, which greatly influenced the amplitude of the isotopic values, and respective isotopic niche width. On the other hand, gulls adopting a mix strategy might be very selective in the consumption of foods, taking great advantage of their potential plasticity on both marine and terrestrial environments. This study highlights an overall preference for the marine and mix strategies in yellow-legged gulls.","Mendes, Roberto F.

"savedrecs (30).txt","1. Recent advances in biologging have resulted in animal location data at unprecedentedly high temporal resolutions, sometimes many times per second. However, many current methods for analysing animal movement (e.g. step selection analysis or state-space modelling) were developed with lower-resolution data in mind. To make such methods usable with high-resolution data, we require techniques to identify features within the trajectory where movement deviates from a straight line.
2. We propose that the intricacies of movement paths, and particularly turns, reflect decisions made by animals so that turn points are particularly relevant to behavioural ecologists. As such, we introduce a fast, accurate algorithm for inferring turning-points in high-resolution data. For analysing big data, speed and scalability are vitally important. We test our algorithm on simulated data, where varying amounts of noise were added to paths of straight-line segments interspersed with turns. We also demonstrate our algorithm on data of free-ranging oryx Oryx leucoryx. We compare our algorithm to existing statistical techniques for break-point inference.
3. The algorithm scales linearly and can analyse several hundred-thousand data points in a few seconds on a mid-range desktop computer. It identified turnpoints in simulated data with complete accuracy when the noise in the headings had a standard deviation of +/- 8 degrees, well within the tolerance of many modern biologgers. It has comparable accuracy to the existing algorithms tested, and is up to three orders of magnitude faster.
4. Our algorithm, freely available in R and Python, serves as an initial step in processing ultra high-resolution animal movement data, resulting in a rarefied path that can be used as an input into many existing step-and-turn methods of analysis. The resulting path consists of points where the animal makes a clear turn, and thereby provides valuable data on decisions underlying movement patterns. As such, it provides an important breakthrough required as a starting point for analysing subsecond resolution data.","Potts, Jonathan R.

"savedrecs (30).txt","We investigated the properties of pedestrian inflow into a room (with one entrance and one exit) in two different conditions: without inactive persons and with the presence of inactive persons, who are pedestrians that after entering the room find randomly a position to stop, obstructing the inflow of the normal pedestrians. The average mutual distance (MD), calculated averaging over all the distances between any two pedestrians, indicates that the spatial distribution of the pedestrians is different from that obtained by uniformly random distributed pedestrians occupying the same space as that of the room. The comparison of the (MD) with that of uniform spatial distributions obtained by using different room lengths suggests that the position of the exit could affect the spatial distribution of the pedestrians, who tend to randomly occupy the space which is delimited by the position of the exit. The analysis of the distance time series (which is the series of distances between successive positions occupied by a pedestrian) shows that the mean maximum distance is rather large when inactive persons obstructs the movement of the normal pedestrians; furthermore it tends to increase with the increase of the number of inactive persons, while in case of absence of inactive persons there is an apparent decrease with the increase of number of moving people. The detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) applied to the distance time series shows that in both conditions pedestrians move persistently; however, without inactive persons DFA scaling exponent tends to slightly increase and stabilize with the increase of the number of moving people; with the presence of inactive persons, it tends to slightly decrease with the increase of the number of inactive persons. The obtained results contribute to a better understanding of the dynamical properties of pedestrian inflow processes, maybe leading to a better mathematical assessment of inflow models.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Electroencephalography (EEG) signals have great impact on the development of assistive rehabilitation devices. These signals are used as a popular tool to investigate the functions and the behavior of the human motion in recent research. The study of EEG-based control of assistive devices is still in early stages. Although the EEG-based control of assistive devices has attracted a considerable level of attention over the last few years, few studies have been carried out to systematically review these studies, as a means of offering researchers and experts a comprehensive summary of the present, state-of-the-art EEG-based control techniques used for assistive technology. Therefore, this research has three main goals. The first aim is to systematically gather, summarize, evaluate and synthesize information regarding the accuracy and the value of previous research published in the literature between 2011 and 2018. The second goal is to extensively report on the holistic, experimental outcomes of this domain in relation to current research. It is systematically performed to provide a wealthy image and grounded evidence of the current state of research covering EEG-based control for assistive rehabilitation devices to all the experts and scientists.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) containing a three-orthogonal gyroscope and three-orthogonal accelerometer has been widely utilized in position and navigation, due to gradually improved accuracy and its small size and low cost. However, the errors of a MEMS IMU based standalone Inertial Navigation System (INS) will diverge over time dramatically, since there are various and nonlinear errors contained in the MEMS IMU measurements. Therefore, MEMS INS is usually integrated with a Global Positioning System (GPS) for providing reliable navigation solutions. The GPS receiver is able to generate stable and precise position and time information in open sky environment. However, under signal challenging conditions, for instance dense forests, city canyons, or mountain valleys, if the GPS signal is weak and even is blocked, the GPS receiver will fail to output reliable positioning information, and the integration system will fade to an INS standalone system. A number of effects have been devoted to improving the accuracy of INS, and de-nosing or modelling the random errors contained in the MEMS IMU have been demonstrated to be an effective way of improving MEMS INS performance. In this paper, an Artificial Intelligence (AI) method was proposed to de-noise the MEMS IMU output signals, specifically, a popular variant of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) RNN was employed to filter the MEMS gyroscope outputs, in which the signals were treated as time series. A MEMS IMU (MSI3200, manufactured by MT Microsystems Company, Shijiazhuang, China) was employed to test the proposed method, a 2 min raw gyroscope data with 400 Hz sampling rate was collected and employed in this testing. The results show that the standard deviation (STD) of the gyroscope data decreased by 60.3%, 37%, and 44.6% respectively compared with raw signals, and on the other way, the three-axis attitude errors decreased by 15.8%, 18.3% and 51.3% individually. Further, compared with an Auto Regressive and Moving Average (ARMA) model with fixed parameters, the STD of the three-axis gyroscope outputs decreased by 42.4%, 21.4% and 21.4%, and the attitude errors decreased by 47.6%, 42.3% and 52.0%. The results indicated that the de-noising scheme was effective for improving MEMS INS accuracy, and the proposed LSTM-RNN method was more preferable in this application.","Jiang, Changhui

"savedrecs (30).txt","Grazing and ruminating are the most important behaviours for ruminants, as they spend most of their daily time budget performing these. Continuous surveillance of eating behaviour is an important means for monitoring ruminant health, productivity and welfare. However, surveillance performed by human operators is prone to human variance, time-consuming and costly, especially on animals kept at pasture or free-ranging. The use of sensors to automatically acquire data, and software to classify and identify behaviours, offers significant potential in addressing such issues. In this work, data collected from sheep by means of an accelerometer/gyroscope sensor attached to the ear and collar, sampled at 16 Hz, were used to develop classifiers for grazing and ruminating behaviour using various machine learning algorithms: random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), k nearest neighbour (kNN) and adaptive boosting (Adaboost). Multiple features extracted from the signals were ranked on their importance for classification. Several performance indicators were considered when comparing classifiers as a function of algorithm used, sensor localisation and number of used features. Random forest yielded the highest overall accuracies: 92% for collar and 91% for ear. Gyroscope-based features were shown to have the greatest relative importance for eating behaviours. The optimum number of feature characteristics to be incorporated into the model was 39, from both ear and collar data. The findings suggest that one can successfully classify eating behaviours in sheep with very high accuracy; this could be used to develop a device for automatic monitoring of feed intake in the sheep sector to monitor health and welfare.","Mansbridge, Nicola

"savedrecs (30).txt","IntroductionSedentary time and time spent in various intensity-specific physical activity are co-dependent, and increasing time spent in one behaviour requires decreased time in another.ObjectiveThe aim of the present study was to examine the theoretical associations with reallocating time between categories of intensities and cardiometabolic risk factors in a large and heterogeneous sample of children and adolescents.MethodsWe analysed pooled data from 13 studies comprising 18,200 children and adolescents aged 4-18years from the International Children's Accelerometry Database (ICAD). Waist-mounted accelerometers measured sedentary time, light physical activity (LPA) and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Cardiometabolic risk factors included waist circumference (WC), systolic blood pressure (SBP), fasting high- and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C and LDL-C), triglycerides, insulin, and glucose. Associations of reallocating time between the various intensity categories with cardiometabolic risk factors were explored using isotemporal substitution modelling.ResultsReplacing 10min of sedentary time with 10min of MVPA showed favourable associations with WC, SBP, LDL-C, insulin, triglycerides, and glucose; the greatest magnitude was observed for insulin (reduction of 2-4%), WC (reduction of 0.5-1%), and triglycerides (1-2%). In addition, replacing 10min of sedentary time with an equal amount of LPA showed beneficial associations with WC, although only in adolescents.ConclusionsReplacing sedentary time and/or LPA with MVPA in children and adolescents is favourably associated with most markers of cardiometabolic risk. Efforts aimed at replacing sedentary time with active behaviours, particularly those of at least moderate intensity, appear to be an effective strategy to reduce cardiometabolic risk in young people.","Hansen, Bjorge Herman

"savedrecs (30).txt","Jumping take-off in birds is an explosive behaviour with the goal of providing a rapid transition from ground to airborne locomotion. An effective jump is predicated on the need to maintain dynamic stability through the acceleration phase. The present study concerns understanding how birds retain control of body attitude and trajectory during take-off. Cursory observation suggests that stability is achieved with relatively little cost. However, analysis of the problem shows that the stability margins during jumping are actually very small and that stability considerations play a significant role in the selection of appropriate jumping kinematics. We use theoretical models to understand stability in prehensile takeoff (from a perch) and also in non-prehensile take-off (from the ground). The primary instability is tipping, defined as rotation of the centre of gravity about the ground contact point. Tipping occurs when the centre of pressure falls outside the functional foot. A contribution of the paper is the development of graphical tipping stability margins for both centre of gravity location and acceleration angle. We show that the nose-up angular acceleration extends stability bounds forward and is hence helpful in achieving shallow take-offs. The stability margins are used to interrogate simulated takeoffs of real birds using published experimental kinematic data from a guinea fowl (ground take-off) and a diamond dove (perch take-off). For the guinea fowl, the initial part of the jump is stable; however, simulations exhibit a stuttering instability not observed experimentally that is probably due to the absence of compliance in the idealized joints. The diamond dove model confirms that the foot provides an active torque reaction during take-off, extending the range of stable jump angles by around 45 degrees.","Parslew, Ben

"savedrecs (30).txt","Many snakes are uniquely adapted to ingest large prey at infrequent intervals. Digestion of large prey is metabolically and aerobically costly, and large prey boluses can impair snake locomotion, increasing vulnerability to predation. Cessation of foraging and use of refugia with microclimates facilitating digestion are expected to be strategies employed by free-ranging snakes to cope with the demands of digestion while minimizing risk of predation. However, empirical observations of such submergent behavior from field experiments are limited. The brown treesnake (Serpentes: Colubridae: Boiga irregularis) is a nocturnal, arboreal, colubrid snake that was accidentally introduced to the island of Guam, with ecologically and economically costly consequences. Because tools for brown treesnake damage prevention generally rely on snakes being visible or responding to lures or baits while foraging, cessation of foraging activities after feeding would complicate management. We sought to characterize differences in brown treesnake activity, movement, habitat use, and detectability following feeding of large meals (rodents 33% of the snake's unfed body mass) via radio telemetry, trapping, and visual surveys. Compared to unfed snakes, snakes in the feeding treatment group showed drastic decreases in hourly and nightly activity rates, differences in refuge height and microhabitat type, and a marked decrease in detectability by trapping and visual surveys. Depression of activity lasted approximately 5-7 days, a period that corresponds to previous studies of brown treesnake digestion and cycles of detectability. Our results indicate that management strategies for invasive brown treesnakes need to account for cycles of unavailability and underscore the importance of preventing spread of brown treesnakes to new environments where large prey are abundant and periods of cryptic behavior are likely to be frequent. Characterization of postfeeding behavior changes provides a richer understanding of snake ecology and foraging models for species that consume large prey.","Siers, Shane R.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Focal animal sampling and continuous recording of behavior in situ are essential in the study of ecology. However, observation gaps and missing records are unavoidable because the focal individual can move out of sight and recording devices do not always work properly. Using an inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) framework, we have developed a novel gap-filling method to predict the most likely route that an animal would have traveled; within this framework, an algorithm learns a reward function from animal trajectories to find the environmental features preferred by the animal. We applied this approach to GPS trajectories obtained from streaked shearwaters (Calonectris leucomelas) and provide evidence of the advantages of the IRL approach over previously used interpolation methods. These advantages are as follows: (1) No assumptions about the parametric distribution governing movements are needed, (2) no assumptions regarding landscape preferences and restrictions are needed, and (3) large spatiotemporal gaps can be filled. This work demonstrates how IRL can enhance the ability to fill gaps in animal trajectories and construct reward-space maps in heterogeneous environments. The proposed methodology can assist movement research, which seeks to understand phenomena that are ecologically and evolutionarily significant, such as habitat selection and migration.","Hirakawa, Tsubasa

This study proposes a wearable device to identify the bodily postures of older persons, while also looking into the perceptions of the users. For the purposes of this study, thirty independent and semi-independent older persons undertook eight different types of physical activity, including: walking, raising arms, lowering arms, leaning forward, sitting, sitting upright, transitioning from standing to sitting, and transitioning from sitting to standing. The data was classified offline, achieving an accuracy of 93.5%, while overall device user perception was positive.

"savedrecs (30).txt","In this paper, the BATS project is presented, which aims to track the behavior of bats via an ultra-low power wireless sensor network. An overview about the whole project and its parts like sensor node design, tracking grid and software infrastructure is given and the evaluation of the project is shown. The BATS project includes a lightweight sensor node that is attached to bats and combines multiple features. Communication among sensor nodes allows tracking of bat encounters. Flight trajectories of individual tagged bats can be recorded at high spatial and temporal resolution by a ground node grid. To increase the communication range, the BATS project implemented a long-range telemetry system to still receive sensor data outside the standard ground node network. The whole system is designed with the common goal of ultra-low energy consumption while still maintaining optimal measurement results. To this end, the system is designed in a flexible way and is able to adapt its functionality according to the current situation. In this way, it uses the energy available on the sensor node as efficient as possible.","Duda, Niklas

"savedrecs (30).txt","ActiGraph is the most common accelerometer in physical activity research, but it has measurement errors due to restrictive frequency filtering. This study investigated biomechanically how different frequency filtering of accelerometer data affects assessment of activity intensity and age-group differences when measuring physical activity. Data from accelerometer at the hip and motion capture system was recorded during treadmill walking and running from 30 subjects in three different age groups: 10, 15, and >20 years old. Acceleration data was processed to ActiGraph counts with original band-pass filter at 1.66 Hz, to counts with wider filter at either 4 or 10 Hz, and to unfiltered acceleration according to Euclidian norm minus one (ENMO). Internal and external power, step frequency, and vertical displacement of center of mass (VD) were estimated from the motion capture data. Widening the frequency filter improved the relationship between higher locomotion speed and counts. It also removed age-group differences and decreased within-group variation. While ActiGraph counts were almost exclusively explained by VD, the counts from the 10 Hz filter were explained by VD and step frequency to an equal degree. In conclusion, a wider frequency filter improves assessment of physical activity intensity by more accurately capturing individual gait patterns.","Fridolfsson, Jonatan

"savedrecs (30).txt","Intense human motion, such as hitting, kicking, and falling, in some particular scenes indicates the occurrence of abnormal events like violence and school bullying. Camera-based human motion detection is an effective way to analyze human behavior and detect intense human motion. However, even if the camera is properly deployed, it will still generate blind spots. Moreover, camera-based methods cannot be used in places such as restrooms and dressing rooms due to privacy issues. In this paper, we propose a multi-target intense human motion detection scheme using commercial Wi-Fi infrastructures. Compared with human daily activities, intense human motion usually has the characteristics of intensity, rapid change, irregularity, large amplitude, and continuity. We studied the changing pattern of Channel State Information (CSI) influenced by intense human motion, and extracted features in the pattern by conducting a large number of experiments. Considering occlusion exists in some complex scenarios, we distinguished the Line-of-Sight (LOS) and Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) conditions in the case of obstacles appearing between the transmitter and the receiver, which further improves the overall performance. We implemented the intense human motion detection system using single commercial Wi-Fi devices, and evaluated it in real indoor environments. The experimental results show that our system can achieve intense human motion detection rate of 90%.","Liu, Jialin

"savedrecs (30).txt","Detecting and monitoring of abnormal movement behaviors in patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD) and individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are beneficial for adjusting care and medical treatment in order to improve the patient's quality of life. Supervised methods commonly used in the literature need annotation of data, which is a time-consuming and costly process. In this paper, we propose deep normative modeling as a probabilistic novelty detection method, in which we model the distribution of normal human movements recorded by wearable sensors and try to detect abnormal movements in patients with PD and ASD in a novelty detection framework. In the proposed deep normative model, a movement disorder behavior is treated as an extreme of the normal range or, equivalently, as a deviation from the normal movements. Our experiments on three benchmark datasets indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which outperforms one-class SVM and the reconstruction-based novelty detection approaches. Our contribution opens the door toward modeling normal human movements during daily activities using wearable sensors and eventually real-time abnormal movement detection in neuro-developmental and neuro-degenerative disorders.","Rad, Nastaran Mohammadian

"savedrecs (30).txt","To accurately measure human motion at high-speed, we proposed a simple structure complementary filter, named the Fuzzy Tuned and Second EStimator of the Optimal Quaternion Complementary Filter (FTECF). The FTECF is applicable to inertial and magnetic sensors, which include tri-axis gyroscopes, tri-axis accelerometers, and tri-axis magnetometers. More specifically, the proposed method incorporates three parts, the input quaternion, the reference quaternion, and the fuzzy logic algorithm. At first, the input quaternion was calculated with gyroscopes. Then, the reference quaternion was calculated by applying the Second EStimator of the Optimal Quaternion (ESOQ-2) algorithm on accelerometers and magnetometers. In addition, we added compensation for accelerometers in the ESOQ-2 algorithm so as to eliminate the effects of limb motion acceleration in high-speed human motion measurements. Finally, the fuzzy logic was utilized to calculate the fusion factor for a complementary filter, so as to adaptively fuse the input quaternion with the reference quaternion. Additionally, the overall algorithm design is more simplified than traditional methods. Confirmed by the experiments, using a commercial inertial and magnetic sensors unit and an optical motion capture system, the efficiency of the proposed method was more improved than two well-known methods. The root mean square error (RMSE) of the FTECF was less than 2.2 degrees and the maximum error was less than 5.4 degrees.","Zhang, Xiaoyue

"savedrecs (30).txt","The homing pigeon (Columba Livia) has long served as a study species to exhaustively investigate the sensory and spatial (map)-representational mechanisms that guide avian navigation. However, several factors have contributed to recent questioning of whether homing pigeons are as valuable as they once were as a general model for the study of the sensory and map-like, spatial-representational mechanisms of avian navigation. These reservations include: the success of this research program in unveiling navigational mechanisms; the burgeoning of new tracking technologies making navigational experiments on long-distance migratory and other wild birds much more accessible; the almost complete loss of the historically dominant, large-scale pigeon loft/research facilities; and prohibitive university per diem costs as well as animal care and use restrictions. Nevertheless, I propose here that there remain good prospects for homing pigeon research that could still profoundly influence how one understands aspects of avian navigation beyond sensory mechanisms and spatial-representational strategies. Indeed, research into neural mechanisms and brain organization, social/personality influences and genetics of navigation all offer opportunities to take advantage of the rich spatial behavior repertoire and experimental convenience of homing pigeons. Importantly, research in these areas would not necessarily require the large number of birds typically used in the past to study the sensory guidance of navigation. For those of us who have had the opportunity to work with this remarkable animal, one research door may be closing, but a window into exciting future opportunities lies ajar.","Bingman, Verner P.","Bingman, VP",NA,NA,"[Bingman, Verner P.] Bowling Green State Univ, Dept Psychol, Bowling Green, OH 43403 USA./[Bingman, Verner P.] Bowling Green State Univ, JP Scott Ctr Neurosci Mind & Behav, Bowling Green, OH 43403 USA.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Navigational map; Familiar area map; Migratory navigation; Olfaction;

"savedrecs (30).txt","Although movement in response to environmental conditions represents a fundamental link between animal behaviour and population ecology, it is rarely investigated in suspension feeders because they are generally perceived as sessile. Here, the interplay between water flow and fine locomotor and feeding behaviours was experimentally investigated for the first time in a free-moving suspension-feeding sea cucumber (Cucumaria frondosa; Echinodermata, Holothuroidea) using time-lapse videography in a mesocosm setting. Individuals moved away from static conditions in the weakest flow treatment and fled the strongest flows (>40 cm s(-1)) in the more dynamic treatments. The tentacles of individuals located in areas with flows of >= 40 cm s(-1) was aligned with the direction of the current, whereas in flows <40 cm s(-1), they were typically perpendicular to the direction of flow. Tentacle deployment and insertion rates (i.e. feeding rate) increased with flow, from 0.95 min(-1) at 10 cm s(-1) to 1.13 min(-1) at 40 cm s(-1). Three modes of locomotion were detected. Forward crawling was most frequent at flows <= 40 cm s(-1), passive rolling dominated at flows >40 cm s(-1) and active rolling occurred randomly at flows between 0 and 120 cm s(-1). Overall, the flow regime favoured by C. frondosa was determined to be between 21 and 40 cm s(-1), under which an optimal balance between efficient food capture and energy expenditure for attachment to the bottom was presumably found. These findings provide insight into the distribution and population dynamics of suspension-feeding holothuroids, and may also assist the fisheries management and aquaculture development of commercial species.","Sun, Jiamin

"savedrecs (30).txt","Active networks are omnipresent in nature, from the molecular to the macro-scale. In this study, we explore the mechanical behaviour of fire ant aggregations, closely knit swarms that display impressive dynamics culminating with the aggregations' capacity to self-heal and adapt to the environment. Although the combined elasticity and rheology of the ant aggregation can be characterized by phenomenological mechanical models (e.g. linear Maxwell or Kelvin-Voigt model), it is not clear how the behaviour of individual ants affects the aggregations' emerging responses. Here, we explore an alternative way to think about these materials, describing them as a collection of individuals connected via elastic chains that associate and dissociate over time. Using our knowledge of these connections-e.g. their elasticity and attachment/dissociation rates-we construct a statistical description of connection stretch and derive an evolution equation for the corresponding stretch distribution. This time-evolving stretch distribution is then used to determine important macroscopic measures, e.g. stress, energy storage and energy dissipation, in the network. In this context, we show how the physical characteristics and activities of individual ants can explain the elasticity, flow and shear thinning of the aggregation. In particular, we find that experimental results are matched if the detachment rate between two individuals increases with tension in the connection.","Vernerey, Franck J.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Telemetry error is not regularly considered in aquatic studies; however, when it is considered, it is generally treated as a static value despite high variation that can occur even within a single tracking event. We describe a simple procedure for using received signal strength (RSS) to estimate telemetry error. We recorded the RSSs of ground- and air-based detections of large (11g; 11x59mm) and small (8g; 11x43mm) 172-MHz radio transmitters across a range of distances. Received signal strength was an excellent predictor of the distance to transmitter for ground tracking detections (large transmitter: r(2)=0.98; small transmitter: r(2)=0.97) and a fair predictor for aerial detections (large transmitter: r(2)=0.49; small transmitter: r(2)=0.57). We also manipulated transmitter antenna lengths and unexpectedly found that both transmitters performed better with shorter antennas relative to factory lengths. With calibrated models relating RSS to the distance to transmitter, RSSs from field-collected data can be used to approximate telemetry error and draw spatial confidence areas around location estimates for analysis and interpretation. During a concurrent movement study, we estimated telemetry error for 2,436 detections of fish at large. Ground tracking error estimates ranged from 1 to 131m (median=24m), and aerial error estimates were most often less than 300m but were as high as 1km. The benefits of representing telemetry data as spatial confidence areas guided by the RSS of each detection are discussed. With appropriate caution, this method will provide a more robust alternative to the assumption that error is constant, negligible, or both.","Heim, Kurt C.

"savedrecs (30).txt","1. Sea turtles are globally endangered, and face daily anthropogenic threats, such as direct take, by-catch, and habitat degradation. Current research efforts on sea turtles in the South China region mainly focus on captivity and husbandry, haematology and blood chemistry, and nesting ecology. Published information on the marine habitat use of wild populations is limited. 2. This situation therefore creates a pressing need for scientific research on freeranging sea turtles as a foundation for habitat management and species protection in South China. In this study, habitat use and oceanic movement of nesting, and bycatch or stranded green turtles, were determined by satellite tracking combined with home-range analysis. 3. Coupled with previous findings, the foraging grounds of several sea turtle species (green turtle Chelonia mydas, hawksbill turtle Eretmochelys imbricata and loggerhead Caretta caretta) were mainly distributed along the coasts of Hainan Island Province and Guangdong Province, mainland China, as well as Taiwan and the Philippines, and the outlying islands in the South China Sea and East China Sea. 4. Habitat hot spots and migratory corridors of green turtles, in particular nesting turtles in South China, were identified. Coastal waters near Wanning City of Hainan Island, the eastern Leizhou Peninsula, Iriomote-jima and Ishigaki-shima of the Ryukyu Islands of Japan, and Dao Bach Long Vi of Vietnam serve as foraging grounds for nesting green turtles from different origins in South China. Moreover, the Paracel (Xisha) and the Pratas (Dongsha) Islands in the South China Sea, Huidong Gangkou, and its vicinity in mainland China, and Liouciou Island and Penghu Island of Taiwan contain both nesting sites and foraging grounds for green turtles. 5. The sites that are associated with migratory corridors, in particular Hainan Island, eastern Leizhou Peninsula, and Liouciou Island, which currently lack conservation plans for sea turtles, should be given higher priority for habitat and species protection.","Ng, Connie Ka Yan

"savedrecs (30).txt","Understanding animal movement and habitat use is critical for the delineation of habitat requiring protection for species at risk. Defining critical habitat requires studies with observations at a fine enough scale to reflect how animals use and move among habitats and include enough individuals to generalize findings to the population. We present results of a multiyear study on 48 adult Wood Turtles (Glyptemys insculpta (Le Conte, 1830)) from two different populations monitored with low-requency radiotelemetry and high-frequency GPS telemetry. Results demonstrated the propensity for conventional radiotelemetry to underestimate cumulative distances moved and overestimate the amount of habitat used by Wood Turtles. Together the two data sets demonstrate the propensity for Wood Turtles to remain in close proximity to the river and that some differences in habitat use occur between the sexes; males tended to move parallel to the river, whereas females moved perpendicular to the river. The GPS-telemetry data provided a robust spatiotemporal data set that provided a better understanding of frequently used habitat types and features. Overall, study results suggest that currently delineated areas of protected habitat are likely to be effective in conserving these two populations and provides significantly improved, spatially explicit knowledge that can be used to inform further mitigation efforts if necessary.","Thompson, D.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Very little is known about how morphology affects the motion, spatial stability and resulting viability of avian eggs. The limited existing research focuses on the uniquely pyriform egg shapes found in the Alcidae bird family. This unusual shell shape was originally thought to suppress displacement and prevent egg loss on the cliffside nesting habitat of the Uria genus. Unfortunately, these early studies never isolated or quantified the specific morphological features (elongation, asymmetry and conicality) of these pyriform eggs, which limits their applicability to other taxa and has hampered a robust proof of concept. We isolated each feature as an enumerated variable, produced model 3D printed eggs with incremental expressions of a single variable and then with all three features co-varying simultaneously. Recorded motion (egg-rolling) trials were conducted to test the individual and combined effects of each morphological characteristic on displacement over a range of inclines representative of the conditions found in natural habitats. Increasing elongation and asymmetry significantly increased displacement, whereas increased conicality decreased displacement in the single-variable egg models. In the multivariable egg models, only conicality consistently suppressed displacement, while lower levels of asymmetry significantly increased displacement. Our findings broadly support previous studies' assertions of the adaptive value of the pyriform eggs while also providing methodology and comparative data for future analyses of the interactions between nesting habitat, behavior and egg shape, beyond the confines of a handful of focal species.","Hays, Ian R.

"savedrecs (30).txt","During migration, birds require stopover habitat to rest and refuel before resuming flight. While long-distance migratory flights represent a large energy investment, stopover accounts for roughly two-thirds of a bird's total energy expenditure during migration. Therefore, birds should minimize energy expenditure while also minimizing time and predation risk during stopover. To understand activity during migration, we recorded activity patterns (i.e. fine-scale movements associated with a range of behaviors) of 3 species, Red-eyed Vireo (Vireo olivaceus), Swainson's Thrush (Catharus ustulatus), and Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina), at a stopover site along the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico during autumn migration using automated radio telemetry. We found Red-eyed Vireos to be the most active and Swainson's Thrushes the least active. For each species, we used boosted regression trees to investigate associations between activity and factors known to influence bird behavior during stopover. While species differed, day of year and temperature were important predictors of activity for all species. Vireos were active early in the season, under light winds and warmer temperatures, and on evenings when winds were more favorable. Thrushes were more active as the season progressed and when temperatures were cooler. Thrush activity also differed between years, although thrushes increased activity later in the season during all years. Our results illustrate automated radio telemetry as a unique and valuable tool for understanding fine-scale behaviors of birds during stopover.","Schofield, Lynn N.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Damaraland and naked mole rat are eusocial mammals that live in crowded burrows in which CO2 is elevated. These species are thought to be highly tolerant of CO2 but their behavioural responses to hypercapnia are poorly understood. We hypothesized that Damaraland and naked mole rats would exhibit blunted behavioural responses to hypercapnia and predicted that their activity levels would be unaffected at low to moderate (2-5%) CO2 but increased at > 7% CO2. To test this, we exposed Damaraland and naked mole rats to stepwise increases in environmental CO2 (0-10%) and measured activity, exploratory behaviour, and body temperature. Surprisingly, we found that both species exhibited no differences in movement velocity, distance travelled, zone transitions (exploration), or body temperature at any level of environmental hypercapnia. Conversely, when carbonic anhydrase was inhibited with acetazolamide (50 mg kg(-1) intraperitonially, to increase whole-animal acidosis), exploration was significantly elevated relative to hypercapnic controls in both species at all levels of inhaled CO2, and naked mole rat body temperature decreased in > 7% CO2. We conclude that both species are largely non-responsive to environmental CO2, and that this tolerance may be dependent on bicarbonate buffering at the level of the kidney or within the blood.","Branigan, Travis

"savedrecs (30).txt","Analyzing how animals are distributed in space and time is important to understand the behavioural interactions that underlie population dynamics, especially for highly social species. Thick-billed murres (Uria lomvia) breed in some of the largest and densest colonies of any seabird. Although this bird is known to aggregate at sea, little is known about when, where, and why the birds form aggregations. We examined the spatial and temporal patterns of foraging aggregations during the breeding season through various scales via (1) measurement of the synchrony of arrivals of adults feeding their chicks at the colony, and (2) use of both GPS and camera loggers attached on the birds to examine the proximity of birds at sea. Adult arrivals at the colony were synchronised when bringing capelin (Mallotus villosus), a gregarious pelagic fish, but not when bringing sculpin (primarily Triglops spp.), a solitary benthic fish. Camera loggers revealed very close encounters of foraging conspecific (< 4 m), much closer than what was predicted by chance, despite low prey densities. GPS loggers also showed diffuse at-sea aggregations with minimal distances closer than expected by chance. However, those study birds did not typically share foraging trajectories. We suggest that, at smaller scales, murres form tight groups to increase searching efficiency underwater. At larger scales, murre aggregations are most likely a result of foraging individuals converging in the more prolific areas, either by independently encountering prey hotspots, or by cueing on other foraging birds.","Brisson-Curadeau, Emile

"savedrecs (30).txt","Eutrophication of coastal areas as a consequence of the agricultural use of fertilizers is a widespread problem. The development of artificial lakes and constructed wetlands in nutrient-rich rivers is a widely used management tool in the fight to decrease eutrophication. Juvenile salmonids that have to negotiate these lakes during their downstream migration to the sea are commonly subjected to high mortality due to increased predation pressure and delayed passage. In this study, we double tagged 39 brown trout smolts with passive integrated transponder and radio tags to gain further insight into predation rates and migration patterns during their passage of an artificial lake in a Danish lowland stream in the spring of 2016. Thirty-four of the tagged smolts, caught and released upstream, entered the lake, of which 22 (65%) successfully exited the lake. Four smolts (12%) returned upstream to the river. Three smolts were predated in the lake by two northern pike (Esox lucius). Three tags were recovered from the lake bottom, and two disappeared out of the study area after a last detection in the lake. Tracking the smolts manually and by automatic listening stations showed highly erratic movement patterns during lake passage. Further, we observed long delays of up to 27days after the smolts reached the river mouth and before they entered the sea, potentially due to low sea water temperature or due to the stocking of a large amount of hatchery-reared brown trout smolts. The results are discussed in the context of abiotic and biotic factors, which differed considerably in the year 2016 compared with previous years.","Schwinn, Michael

"savedrecs (30).txt","The spawning migration of Atlantic salmon has been characterized by tracking salmon carrying electronic tags as they ascend rivers, but still little is known about how natural obstacles such as waterfalls influence migratory behaviour and how such behaviours are mediated by various biotic (e.g., fish size) and abiotic (e.g., discharge, water temperature, and barometric pressure) factors. The Norwegian river Numedalslagen is interrupted by natural waterfalls ranging in height from 2 to 6m. We tagged 113 Atlantic salmon with radio transmitters in the estuary and used stationary radio telemetry stations to track fish. Ninety-one salmon were recorded in Numedalslagen, 39 of which remained in the river for spawning. Large salmon moved farther and faster upriver but also delayed longer and had lower daily probability to pass the second waterfall. Delay below and passage probability at the final, largest waterfall was affected by water discharge, wherein passage occurred when discharge was declining. Barometric pressure also influenced daily probability of ascent, albeit in opposite directions for each waterfall. Importantly, we also found that salmon with surgically implanted radio transmitters moved farther upriver on average and delayed less time below one of the waterfalls than those with externally attached transmitters. Although there is variance in timing arising from individual decision-making, we showed that natural waterfalls delay progress of Atlantic salmon on their spawning migration and that both biotic (i.e., size) and abiotic (i.e., barometric pressure and discharge) factors influenced the salmon's decisions to pass waterfalls that they encounter.","Lennox, Robert J.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Streamflow drives ecological processes across multiple trophic levels making it a master variable in lotic systems. In mountain systems, especially those that are regulated, increased frequency of droughts and reductions in snowpack may alter future streamflow regimes and impact ecological processes. We monitored invertebrate drift abundance, size, and diversity as a function of streamflow. We then related these variables to fish movement and energetic efficiencies in the Upper Shasta River in California, above and below a large streamflow diversion. Invertebrate drift biomass was significantly less at impaired flows compared with unimpaired flows, and average body size of invertebrates decreased with decreasing streamflow. Generally, fish movement was greater at the impaired flow site (>50% of the time fish were tracked). Fish movement at the upstream site was negatively related to the size of individual prey items and amount of prey available, and significant drivers were not detected in the flow-impaired site. Energetic efficiency was reduced by over 70% when search foraging took place, and the net rate of energetic intake was below 0J/s for low-flow periods. Our results suggest that fish foraging behaviour may be influenced indirectly by altered streamflow through changes to amount and size of invertebrate drift. A shift to foraging behaviour, coupled with low food availability, results in decreased energetic efficiency. Future prescriptions of flow rates to regulated rivers should account for changes to invertebrate drift, fish behaviour, and fish energetics on seasonal time scales.","Caldwell, Timothy J.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Winters are limiting for many terrestrial animals due to energy deficits brought on by resource scarcity and the increased metabolic costs of thermoregulation and traveling through snow. A better understanding of how animals respond to snow conditions is needed to predict the impacts of climate change on wildlife. We compared the performance of remotely sensed and modeled snow products as predictors of winter movements at multiple spatial and temporal scales using a data set of 20,544 locations from 30 GPS-collared Dall sheep (Ovis dalli dalli) in Lake Clark National Park and Preserve, Alaska, USA from 2005 to 2008. We used daily 500-m MODIS normalized difference snow index (NDSI), and multi-resolution snow depth and density outputs from a snowpack evolution model (SnowModel), as covariates in step selection functions. We predicted that modeled snow depth would perform best across all scales of selection due to more informative spatiotemporal variation and relevance to animal movement. Our results indicated that adding any of the evaluated snow metrics substantially improved model performance and helped characterize winter Dall sheep movements. As expected, SnowModel-simulated snow depth outperformed NDSI at fine-to-moderate scales of selection (step scales <112 h). At the finest scale, Dall sheep selected for snow depths below mean chest height (<54 cm) when in low-density snows (100 kg/m(3)), which may have facilitated access to ground forage and reduced energy expenditure while traveling. However, sheep selected for higher snow densities (>300kg/m(3)) at snow depths above chest height, which likely further reduced energy expenditure by limiting hoof penetration in deeper snows. At moderate-to-coarse scales (112-896 h step scales), however, NDSI was the best-performing snow covariate. Thus, the use of publicly available, remotely sensed, snow cover products can substantially improve models of animal movement, particularly in cases where movement distances exceed the MODIS 500-m grid threshold. However, remote sensing products may require substantial data thinning due to cloud cover, potentially limiting its power in cases where complex models are necessary. Snowpack evolution models such as SnowModel offer users increased flexibility at the expense of added complexity, but can provide critical insights into fine-scale responses to rapidly changing snow properties.","Mahoney, Peter J.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Recent research suggests that personality, defined as consistent individual behavioral variation, in farm animals could be an important factor when considering their health, welfare, and productivity. However, behavioral tests are often performed individually and they might not reflect the behavioral differences manifested in every-day social environments. Furthermore, the contextual and longer-term temporal stability of personality traits have rarely been investigated in adult dairy cattle. In this study, we tested three groups of lactating Holstein cows (40 cows) using an individual arena test and a novel object test in groups to measure the contextual stability of behavior. Among the recorded individual test parameters, we used seven in the final analysis, which were determined by a systematic parameter reduction procedure. We found positive correlations between novel object contact duration in the group test and individual test parameters object contact duration (R-s = 0.361, P = 0.026) and movement duration (R-s = 0.336, P = 0.039). Both tests were repeated 6 months later to investigate their temporal stability whereby four individual test parameters were repeatable. There was no consistency in the group test results for 25 cows tested twice, possibly due to group composition changes. Furthermore, based on the seven individual test parameters, two personality traits (activity/exploration and boldness) were identified by principal component analysis. We found a positive association between the first and second tests for activity/exploration (R-s = 0.334, P = 0.058) and for boldness (R-s = 0.491, P = 0.004). Our results support the multidimensional nature of personality in adult dairy cattle and they indicate a link between behavior in individual and within-group situations. The lack of stability according to the group test results implies that group companions might have a stronger influence on individual behavior than expected. We suggest repeating the within-group behavioral measurements to study the relationship between the social environment and the manifestation of personality traits in every-day situations.","Foris, Borbala

"savedrecs (30).txt","McPherson's Blau space and affiliation ecology model is a powerful tool for analyzing the ecological competition among social entities, such as organizations, along a combination of sociodemographic characteristics of their members. In this paper we introduce the R-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) package Blaunet, an integrated set of tools to calculate, visualize, and analyze the statuses of individuals and social entities in Blau space, parameterized by multiple sociodemographic traits as dimensions. The package is able to calculate the Blau statuses at the nodal, dyadic, and meso levels based on three types of information: sociodemographic characteristics, group affiliations (e.g., membership in groups/organizations), and network ties. To facilitate this, Blaunet has the following five main capabilities, it can: 1) identify a list of possible salient dimensions; 2) calculate, plot, and analyze niches for social entities by measuring the social distance along the salient dimensions between individuals affiliated with them; 3) generate Blau bubbles for individuals, thereby allowing the study of interpersonal influence of similar others even with limited or no network information; 4) capture niche dynamics cross-sectionally by calculating the intensity of exploitation from the carrying capacity and the membership rate; and 5) analyze the niche movement longitudinally by estimating the predicted niche movement equations. We illustrate these capabilities of Blaunet with example datasets.","Genkin, Michael

"savedrecs (30).txt","Arctic pack ice structure and extent have been changing due to warming. Thus, understanding important habitat features for marine mammals that depend on sea ice, such as narwhal (Monodon monoceros), during winter will provide insight into impacts of future changes within the pack ice. The objective of this study was to determine narwhal habitat selection for bathymetry, sea ice concentration, thickness, and floe size during the winter season. Nineteen narwhals were equipped with SPLASH tags in Admiralty Inlet and Eclipse Sound (2009-2011), with 50% of the transmitters lasting until April allowing for analysis of the entire winter season. Generalized linear mixed models indicated that both sexes selected similar bathymetric habitat likely corresponding to higher prey densities of Greenland halibut. This preference for prey habitat occurred regardless of the mobile pack ice structure or amount of open water at the ocean surface. In addition, we found evidence of a potential relationship between increased winter movements and decreased ice extent over the 2009-2011 period. Together these findings suggest that changes to sea ice structure likely will not negatively impact narwhal directly in the winter. However, indirect effects of changing sea ice, such as changing prey densities and distribution, increased presence of killer whales (Orcinus orca) as predators, increased interspecies competition for prey, and increased anthropogenic activities could influence winter habitat selection of narwhal. In conclusion, the extensive winter movements indicate that narwhal may be more flexible in their selection of winter habitat than previously believed.","Kenyon, Krista A.

"savedrecs (30).txt","A very common honeybee signal is the dorso-ventral abdominal vibration (DVAV) signal, widely accepted as a modulatory signal meaning: ""prepare for greater activity"". In this study, using ultra-sensitive accelerometer technology embedded in the honeycomb, we visually confirm the one-toone relationship between a DVAV signal being produced and the resulting accelerometer waveform, allowing the measurement of DVAV signals without relying on any visual inspection. We then demonstrate a novel method for the continuous in-situ non-invasive automated monitoring of this honeybee signal, not previously known to induce any vibration into the honeycomb, and most often inaudible to human hearing. We monitored a total of three hives in the UK and France, showing that the signal is very common, highly repeatable and occurs more frequently at night, exhibiting a distinct decrease in instances and increase in amplitude towards mid-afternoon. We also show an unprecedented increase in the cumulative amplitude of DVAV signals occurring in the hours preceding and following a primary swarm. We conclude that DVAV signals may have additional functions beyond solely being a foraging activation signal, and that the amplitude of the signal might be indicative of the switching of its purpose.","Ramsey, M.

"savedrecs (30).txt","A powerful tool in motor behavior research is trajectory analysis of discrete goal-directed pointing movements. The purpose of the present analysis was to estimate the minimum number of trials per participant required to achieve the conventional level of reliability for trajectory analysis. We analyzed basic measurements of movement and three common methods of trajectory analysis within the framework of generalizability theory. Generalizability studies were used to decompose the total variance of these variables into the percent contributions from person, trial, and the person-by-trial interaction. Decision studies were then used to determine the minimum number of trials required to achieve the conventional level of reliability. The number of trials per participant needed for reliable data of discrete goal-directed pointing movements depended on the dependent variablefor example, reaction times required six or ten trials, movement times required three trials, and constant error required 47 trials. For trajectory analysis, ten or fewer trials were required for reliable dependent variables during the first half of the movement (up to peak velocity or 70% of the displacement). The number of trials required for the second half of the movement rapidly increased to 47 trials at movement termination. This increase in the number of trials required for reliable analysis of the second half of the movement was indicative of online control. Finally, correlation analysis was performed with simulated correlations on subsets of trials, and all 32 trials were required. However, 18 trials might be used without a practically significant change in the correlations.","Blinch, Jarrod

"savedrecs (30).txt","Translocation of animals from sites scheduled for development is a widespread but controversial intervention to resolve human-wildlife conflicts. Indeed, reptiles are very frequently the subject of such translocations, but there is a paucity of information on the fate of such animals or how their behaviour compares to residents. In 2014, a population of adders (Vipera berus) was translocated from a development site in Essex, UK. A sample of snakes was fitted with external radio tags and tracked for a period of 10 days during the spring. This exercise was repeated during the summer using a combination of translocated and resident individuals. Translocated males exhibited significantly greater average daily movements than resident conspecifics. Furthermore, all translocated males undertook long-distance, unidirectional movements away from the release site. In contrast, all translocated females remained within 50 m of the point of release. One of the males returned to the donor site, crossing large areas of unsuitable habitat in doing so. Translocated males also maintained significantly larger total ranges than resident conspecifics. No differences in range sizes were observed between translocated and resident females. The dispersal of male snakes from the release site may increase the risk of mortality of translocated snakes and reduces the likelihood of establishing a new population. Interventions to encourage the establishment of new home ranges within the boundaries of release sites may include mechanisms to prevent dispersal immediately following release.","Nash, Darryn J.

GLATOS now connects 190+ investigators, provides project consultation, maintains a web-based data portal, contributes data to Ocean Tracking Network's global database, loans equipment, and promotes science transfer to managers. The GLATOS database currently has 50+ projects, 39 species tagged, 8000-i- fish released, and 150+ million tag detections. Lessons learned include (1) seek advice from others experienced in telemetry; (2) organize networks prior to when shared data is urgently needed; (3) establish a data management system so that all receivers can contribute to every project; (4) hold annual meetings to foster relationships; (5) involve fish managers to ensure relevancy; and (6) staff require full-time commitment to lead and coordinate projects and to analyze data and publish results.","Krueger, Charles C.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Some protected species have benefited from human activities to a point where they sometimes raise concerns. However, gaps in knowledge about their human-related behaviour hamper effective management decisions. We studied non-breeding common ravens Corvus corax that aggregated and predated livestock in the surroundings of a landfill. Combining several approaches, we first assessed the effectiveness of relocations at distances ranging from 20 to 240km, and of one-time disturbance consisting in non-lethal shots performed at night roosts and at surrounding foraging areas during two consecutive evenings, in reducing ravens' presence at the landfill. Then, we documented the spatial ecology of both relocated ravens and control ones (i.e. released in situ). Although the return probability widely varied with relocation distance and time after release, homing behaviour (87/102 relocated ravens marked with wing tags [85.3%] returned to the landfill in 3years) prevented relocations from sustainably reducing the presence of ravens. Likewise, one-time disturbance only decreased ravens' abundance during a few hours. These results could be related to the extensive movements of ravens equipped with GPS trackers. The total area occupied by control ravens reached 40,492km(2), i.e. 7.4% of the area of France and 21.7% of the French species distribution range. Individuals used smaller home ranges (min=84; max=1814km(2)), consisting in a network of foraging areas and roosts that they visited. The daily and weekly turnover rates in the observed area of the landfill were high (on average 0.68 +/- 0.2 and 0.36 +/- 0.17, respectively) and the actual presence of ravens displayed strong seasonal variation. Hence, one-time/local management actions affected only a limited proportion of the population, partly explaining their small impact. Our study provides information needed to improve future management plans in a context of increasing ravens populations and conflicts with human activities.","Marchand, Pascal

"savedrecs (30).txt","Context Barrier effects of Large-scale Transportation Infrastructures (LTIs) are among the main factors contributing to the fragmentation of habitats. The reduction of dispersal across LTIs can drive small, local populations to extinction. To understand how LTIs modify dispersal, efficient and workable evaluation methods are required.
Objectives We developed a method based on Mark-Release-Recapture surveys to estimate barrier effects of LTIs that could be easily applied in various landscape contexts and on any mobile species.
Methods Our method uses dispersal kernels of animal movements to calculate an expected probability of crossing any particular linear feature. This probability is then compared to observed crossing events to estimate the barrier effect. We used simulations to test the reliability of our method and applied this framework on the butterfly Maniola jurtina in a landscape fragmented by a motorway and a railway.
Results Simulations showed that our method was able to detect efficiently even weak barrier effects given that enough data are available. When sample size was reduced, our method was able to detect barrier effects only when the infrastructure width was small in comparison to the average movement capacity of organisms. In our case study, both infrastructures acted as significant barriers.
Conclusions The power of our method is to use MRR data which are more representative of population processes than telemetry monitoring and are not limited by time-lag involved in genetic studies. This framework is of particular interest for conservation studies in order to assess how individual movements are modified by linear infrastructures.","Remon, Jonathan

"savedrecs (30).txt","Stable isotope analysis (SIA) can be a useful tool for tracking the long-distance movements of migratory taxa. However, local-scale sources of isotopic variation, such as differences in habitat use or foraging patterns, may complicate these efforts. Few studies have evaluated the implications of local-scale foraging specializations for broad-scale isotope-based tracking. Here, we use > 300 h of animal-borne video footage from green turtles (Chelonia mydas) paired with SIA of multiple tissues, as well as fine-scale Fastloc-GPS satellite tracking, to show that dietary specialization at a single foraging location (Shark Bay, Western Australia) drives a high level of among-individual delta C-13 variability (delta C-13 range = 13.2 parts per thousand). Green turtles in Shark Bay were highly omnivorous and fed selectively, with individuals specializing on different mixtures of seagrasses, macroalgae and invertebrates. Furthermore, green turtle skin delta C-13 and delta N-15 dispersion within this feeding area (total isotopic niche area = 41.6) was comparable to that from a well-studied rookery at Tortuguero, Costa Rica, where isotopic dispersion (total isotopic niche area = 44.9) is known to result from large-scale (> 1500 km) differences in foraging site selection. Thus, we provide an important reminder that two different behavioral dynamics, operating at very different spatial scales, can produce similar levels of isotopic variability. We urge an added degree of caution when interpreting isotope data for migratory species with complex foraging strategies. For green turtles specifically, a greater appreciation of trophic complexity is needed to better understand functional roles, resilience to natural and anthropogenic disturbances, and to improve management strategies.","Thomson, Jordan A.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Many predictive models of spatial and temporal distribution (e.g. in response to climate change or species introductions) assume that species have one environmental niche that applies to all individuals. However, there is growing evidence that individuals can have environmental preferences that are narrower than the species niche. Such individual specialization has mainly been studied in terms of dietary niches, but a recent increase in the availability of individual movement data opens the possibility of extending these analyses to specialisation in environmental preferences. Yet, no study to date on individual specialisation has considered the environmental niche in its multidimensionality. Here we propose a new method for quantifying individual specialisation in multiple dimensions simultaneously. We compare the hypervolumes in n-dimensional environmental niche space of each individual against that of the population, testing for significant differences against a null model. The same method can be applied to a 2-dimensional geographic space to test for site fidelity. We applied this method to test for individual environmental specialisation (across three dimensions: sea surface temperature, eddy kinetic energy, depth) and for site fidelity among satellite-tracked black-browed albatrosses (Thalassarche melanophris) and grey-headed albatrosses (Thalassarche chrysostoma), during chick-rearing at South Georgia. We found evidence for site fidelity in both species and of environmental specialisation among individual grey-headed but not black-browed albatrosses. Specialisation can affect the resilience of populations affected by natural and anthropogenic changes in the environment, and hence has implications for population dynamics and conservation.","Bonnet-Lebrun, A. -S.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Nowadays, video surveillance scenarios usually rely on manually annotated focus areas to constrain automatic video analysis tasks. Although manual annotation simplifies several stages of the analysis, its use hinders the scalability of the developed solutions and might induce operational problems in scenarios recorded with multiple moving cameras (MMCs). To tackle these problems, an automatic method for the cooperative extraction of areas of interest (AoIs) is proposed. Each captured frame is segmented into regions with semantic roles using a state-of-the-art method. Semantic evidences from different junctures, cameras, and points-of-view are, then, spatio-temporally aligned on a common ground plane. Experimental results on widely used datasets recorded with multiple but static cameras suggest that this process provides broader and more accurate AoIs than those manually defined in the datasets. Moreover, the proposed method naturally determines the projection of obstacles and functional objects in the scene, paving the road towards systems focused on the automatic analysis of human behavior. To our knowledge, this is the first study dealing with this problem, as evidenced by the lack of publicly available MMC benchmarks. To also cope with this issue, we provide a new MMC dataset with associated semantic scene annotations.","Lopez-Cifuentes, Alejandro

"savedrecs (30).txt","Moving animal groups often exhibit aggregation behavior. In many species, the collective behavior invariably depends on local interactions among individuals. In such groups, the mechanism of group formation require that interaction rules be followed by all members, and as consequence, animal aggregates such as schools of fish, flocks of birds, and swarms of locusts exhibit a variety of dynamical behavior patterns. In this paper we investigated only the milling pattern. Of particular interest to us is to analyze its dependence on the density and on the number of particles. We found that the milling formation depends of these two physical quantities. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","Cambui, Dorilson S.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Background: The development of satellite tracking technology enables the gathering of huge amounts of accurate data on animal movements over measured time intervals, to reveal essential information about species' patterns of spatial use. This information is especially important in optimizing the design of conservation and management strategies for endangered species. In this study, we analysed the main drivers of daily patterns in the flight activity of the threatened Bearded Vulture Gypaetus barbatus. We studied 19 Bearded Vultures tagged with solar-powered GPS transmitters from 2006 to 2016 in the Pyrenees (Spain). We assessed the relative influence of external factors (season and daylight time) and internal factors (sex, breeding season and territorial status) on their daily activity behaviour by computing mean hourly distance travelled, maximum displacement and cumulative distance travelled per hour.
Results: Our findings showed a clear difference in all the estimators between territorial and non-territorial (floating) members of the population, showing that non-territorial individuals spent much longer in flight and travelled larger distances per day. We detected an important influence of daylight time and season on the daily rhythms of Bearded Vultures; flight activity increased during the last three quarters of daylight and was greatest in the spring. Breeding period and sex had also an effect on the maximum displacement and cumulative distance travelled. Individuals flew more during the breeding period and females tended to exhibit greater cumulative and maximum distances per hour than males regardless of breeding season.
Conclusions: Pyrenean Bearded Vultures flight daily activity was strongly influenced by daylight time, season, and territorial status, while individual sex and breeding season showed a milder effect on the birds' movement behaviour. This study gives a novel insight into how external factors act as main drivers of the daily flight activity pattern of a long-lived avian scavenger.","Garcia-Jimenez, Ruth

"savedrecs (30).txt","Large scale migrations are a key component of the life history of many marine species. We quantified the annual migration cycle of juvenile southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii; SBT) and spatiotemporal variability in this cycle, based on a multi-decadal electronic tagging dataset. Behaviour-switching models allowed for the identification of cohesive areas of residency and classified the temporal sequence of movements within a migration cycle from austral summer foraging grounds in the Great Australian Bight (GAB) to winter foraging grounds in the Indian Ocean and Tasman Sea and back to the GAB. Although specific regions within the Indian Ocean were frequented, individuals did not always return to the same area in consecutive years. Outward migrations from the GAB were typically longer than return migrations back to the GAB. The timing of individual arrivals to the GAB, which may be driven by seasonality in prey availability, was more cohesive than the timing of departures from the GAB, which may be subject to the physiological condition of SBT. A valuable fishery for SBT operates in the GAB, as do a number of scientific research programs designed to monitor SBT for management purposes; thus, understanding SBT migration to and from the area is of high importance to a number of stakeholders.","Patterson, Toby A.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Background: Increases in landscape connectivity can improve a species' ability to cope with habitat fragmentation and degradation. Wildlife corridors increase landscape connectivity and it is therefore important to identify and maintain them. Currently, corridors are mostly identified using methods that rely on generic habitat suitability measures. One important and widely held assumption is that corridors represent swaths of suitable habitat connecting larger patches of suitable habitat in an otherwise unsuitable environment. Using high-resolution GPS data of four large carnivore species, we identified corridors based on animal movement behavior within each individual's home range and quantified the spatial overlap of these corridors. We thus tested whether corridors were in fact spatial bottle necks in habitat suitability surrounded by unsuitable habitat, and if they could be characterized by their coarse-scale environmental composition.
Results: We found that most individuals used corridors within their home ranges and that several corridors were used simultaneously by individuals of the same species, but also by individuals of different species. When we compared the predicted habitat suitability of corridors and their immediate surrounding area we found, however, no differences.
Conclusions: We could not find a direct correspondence between corridors chosen and used by wildlife on the one hand, and a priori habitat suitability measurements on the other hand. This leads us to speculate that identifying corridors relying on typically-used habitat suitability methods alone may misplace corridors at the level of space use within an individual's home range. We suggest future studies to rely more on movement data to directly identify wildlife corridors based on the observed behavior of the animals.","Scharf, Anne K.

"savedrecs (30).txt","In recent decades, a number of studies have examined whether various non-human animals understand their partner's role in cooperative situations. Yet the relatively tolerant timing requirements of these tasks make it theoretically possible for animals to succeed by using simple behavioural strategies rather than by jointly intended coordination. Here we investigated whether bottlenose dolphins could understand a cooperative partner's role by testing whether they could learn a button-pressing task requiring precise behavioural synchronization. Specifically, members of cooperative dyads were required to swim across a lagoon and each press their own underwater button simultaneously (within a 1 s time window), whether sent together or with a delay between partners of 1-20 s. We found that dolphins were able to work together with extreme precision even when they had to wait for their partner, and that their coordination improved over the course of the study, with the time between button presses in the latter trials averaging 370 ms. These findings show that bottlenose dolphins can learn to understand their partner's role in a cooperative situation, and suggest that the behavioural synchronization evident in wild dolphins' synchronous movement and coordinated alliance displays may be a generalized cognitive ability that can also be used to solve novel cooperative tasks.","Jaakkola, Kelly

"savedrecs (30).txt","Ecologists regularly use animal contact networks to describe interactions underlying pathogen transmission, gene flow, and information transfer. However, empirical descriptions of contact often overlook some features of individual movement, and decisions about what kind of network to use in a particular setting are commonly ad hoc. Here, we relate individual movement trajectories to contact networks through a tripartite network model of individual, space, and time nodes. Most networks used in animal contact studies (e.g. individual association networks, home range overlap networks, and spatial networks) are simplifications of this tripartite model. The tripartite structure can incorporate a broad suite of alternative ecological metrics like home range sizes and patch occupancy patterns into inferences about contact network metrics such as modularity and degree distribution. We demonstrate the model's utility with two simulation studies using alternative forms of ecological data to constrain the tripartite network's structure and inform expectations about the harder-to-measure metrics related to contact.","Manlove, Kezia

"savedrecs (30).txt","In this review article, we trace the history of events leading to the development of individual-based models (IBMs) to represent aquatic organisms in rivers and streams. As a metaphor, we present this history as a series of confluences between individual scientists (tributaries) sharing ideas. We describe contributions of these models to science and management. One iconic feature of river IBMs is the linkage between flow and the physical habitat experienced by individual animals, and the first model that focused on this linkage is briefly described. We continue by reviewing the contributions of riverine IBMs to eight broad areas of scientific inquiry. The first four areas include research to understand 1) the effects of flow regimes on fish populations, 2) species interactions (e.g., size-mediated competition and predation), 3) fish movement and habitat selection, and 4) contaminant and water quality impacts on populations. Next, we review research using IBMs 5) to guide conservation biology of imperiled taxa through population viability analysis, including research 6) to understand river fragmentation by dams and reconnection, 7) to understand genetic outcomes for riverine metapopulations, and 8) to anticipate the future effects of temperature and climate change. This rich body of literature has contributed to both theoretical insights (e.g., about animal behavior and life history) and applied insights (e.g., population-level effects of flow regimes, temperature, and the effects of hydropower and other industries that share rivers with aquatic biota). We finish by exploring promising branches that lie ahead in the braided, downstream channel that represents future river modeling research.","Jager, Henriette I.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Fatigue is a very common and costly symptom associated with various diseases and disorders. Nonetheless, understanding the pathobiology and developing of therapies for fatigue have been difficult, partly because of a lack of consensus on the measures to phenotype this behavior, both in clinical settings and in animal studies. Here, we describe a fatigue-like behavior induced in mice by abdominal irradiation and compare three different methods of measuring changes in physical activity over time: running wheels, video home cage monitoring, and telemetry. These methods collect data passively and continuously, requiring no disruption of animals' normal home cage behavior. In our experiments, all three methods reported a fatigue-like behavior, exhibited by a reduction in physical activity following abdominal irradiation. Video tracking showed the largest fatigue effect size (Cohen's D = 1.78) over four days of monitoring, and was the only method showing a significant decrease in activity during the light period. Telemetry and running wheels showed a similar effect size (D = 1.68 and 1.65, respectively), but running wheels showed different circadian patterns of physical activity. In addition, we conducted rotarod and inverted grid suspension tests, which suggested that fatigue-like behavior was not the result of gross motor abnormalities.","Wolff, Brian S.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Rising river temperatures in western North America have increased the energetic costs of migration and the risk of premature mortality in many Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) populations. Predicting and managing risks for these populations requires data on acute and cumulative thermal exposure, the spatio-temporal distribution of adverse conditions, and the potentially mitigating effects of cool-water refuges. In this study, we paired radiotelemetry with archival temperature loggers to construct continuous, spatially-explicit thermal histories for 212 adult Chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha) and 200 adult steelhead (O. mykiss). The fish amassed -500,000 temperature records (30-min intervals) while migrating through 470 kilometers of the Columbia and Snake rivers en route to spawning sites in Idaho, Oregon, and Washington. Spring- and most summer-run Chinook salmon migrated before river temperatures reached annual highs; their body temperatures closely matched ambient temperatures and most had thermal maxima in the lower Snake River. In contrast, many individual fall-run Chinook salmon and most steelhead had maxima near thermal tolerance limits (20-22 degrees C) in the lower Columbia River. High temperatures elicited extensive use of thermal refuges near tributary confluences, where body temperatures were similar to 2-10 degrees C cooler than the adjacent migration corridor. Many steelhead used refuges for weeks or more whereas salmon use was typically hours to days, reflecting differences in spawn timing. Almost no refuge use was detected in a similar to 260-km reach where a thermal migration barrier may more frequently develop in future warmer years. Within population, cumulative thermal exposure was strongly positively correlated (0.88 <= r <= 0.98) with migration duration and inconsistently associated (-0.28 <= r <= 0.09) with migration date. All four populations have likely experienced historically high mean and maximum temperatures in recent years. Expected responses include population-specific shifts in migration phenology, increased reliance on patchily-distributed thermal refuges, and natural selection favoring temperature tolerant phenotypes.","Keefer, Matthew L.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Background: Matching animal movement with the behaviors that shape life history requires a rigorous connection between the observed patterns of space use and inferred behavioral states. As animal-borne dataloggers capture a greater diversity and frequency of three dimensional movements, we can increase the complexity of movement models describing animal behavior. One challenge in combining data streams is the different spatial and temporal frequency of observations. Nested movement models provide a flexible framework for gleaning data from long-duration, but temporally sparse, data sources.
Results: Using a two-layer nested model, we combined geographic and vertical movement to infer traveling, foraging and resting behaviors of Humpback whales off the West Antarctic Peninsula. This approach refined previous work using only geographic data to delineate coarser behavioral states. Our results showed increased intensity in foraging activity in late season animals as the whales prepared to migrate north to tropical calving grounds. Our model also suggests strong diel variation in movement states, likely linked to daily changes in prey distribution.
Conclusions: Using a combination of two-dimensional and three-dimensional movement data, we highlight the connection between whale movement and krill availability, as well as the complex spatial pattern of whale foraging in productive polar waters.","Weinstein, Ben G.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Research utilizing repeated-measures such as daily assessments with self-report and/or objective measures [e.g., physical activity (PA) monitors] are important in understanding health behaviors and informing practice and policy. However, studies that utilize daily assessment often encounter issues with attrition and non-compliance. The current research yielded high levels of retention and adherence with both self-report and objective daily measures. The purpose of this paper is to highlight and discuss strategies utilized in maximizing retention, minimizing missing data, and some lessons learned from the research experience. Fifty community participants took part in a 4-week study utilizing both daily self-report questionnaires and daily use of PA monitors (Fitbit One (TM)). This study focused on typical daily PA and was not an intervention study (e.g., participants were not randomized nor asked to change their PA behavior). Participants completed the study in two waves (wave 1 n = 10, wave 2 n = 40). The research team utilized several retention strategies including automating the data collection process, a prorated incentive structure, having a dedicated and responsive study staff, and utilizing the 2-wave process to optimize data collection during the 2nd wave. The study had 100% retention and generally positive anonymous feedback post-study. Overall, participants completed the vast majority of daily surveys (97%) and wore their Fitbits (for at least part of the day) on almost all days (99.57%) of the study, although there were individual differences. The strategies discussed and lessons learned may be useful to other researchers using daily measurements for whom adherence and retention are important issues. Future research employing these strategies in different populations, with different measurements, and for longer durations is warranted to determine generalizability.","Xu, Xiaomeng

"savedrecs (30).txt","Camera loggers are increasingly used to examine behavioural aspects of free-ranging animals. However, often video loggers are deployed with a focus on specific behavioural traits utilizing small cameras with a limited field of view, poor light performance and video quality. Yet rapid developments in consumer electronics provide new devices with much improved visual data allowing a wider scope for studies employing this novel methodology. We developed a camera logger that records full HD video through a wide-angle lens, providing high resolution footage with a greater field of view than other camera loggers. The main goal was to assess the suitability of this type of camera for the analysis of various aspects of the foraging ecology of a marine predator, the yellow-eyed penguin in New Zealand. Frame-by-frame analysis allowed accurate timing of prey pursuits and time spent over certain seafloor types. The recorded video footage showed that prey species were associated with certain seafloor types, revealed different predator evasion strategies by benthic fishes, and highlighted varying energetic consequences for penguins pursuing certain types of prey. Other aspects that could be analysed were the timing of breathing intervals between dives and observe exhalation events during prey pursuits, a previously undescribed behaviour. Screen overlays facilitated analysis of flipper angles and beat frequencies throughout various stages of the dive cycle. Flipper movement analysis confirmed decreasing effort during descent phases as the bird gained depth, and that ascent was principally passive. Breathing episodes between dives were short (<1 s) while the majority of the time was devoted to subsurface scanning with a submerged head. Video data recorded on free-ranging animals not only provide a wealth of information recorded from a single deployment but also necessitate new approaches with regards to analysis of visual data. Here, we demonstrate the diversity of information that can be gleaned from video logger data, if devices with high video resolution and wide field of view are utilized.","Mattern, Thomas

"savedrecs (30).txt","Home range estimators are a critical component for understanding animal spatial ecology. The choice of home range estimator in spatial ecology studies can significantly influence management and conservation actions, as different methods lead to vastly different interpretations of movement patterns, habitat selection, as well as home range requirements. Reptile studies in particular have struggled to reach a consensus on the appropriate home range estimators to use, and species with cryptic behavior make home range assessment difficult. We applied dynamic Brownian Bridge Movement Models (dBBMMs) to radio-telemetry data from Ophiophagus hannah, a wide-ranging snake species. We used two focal individuals at different life stages (one juvenile male and one adult male) and sought to identify whether the method would accurately represent both their home range and movement patterns. To assess the suitability of dBBMMs, we compared this novel method with traditional home range estimation methods: minimum convex polygons (MCP) and Kernel density estimators (KDE). Both KDE and MCP incorporated higher levels of Type I and Type II errors, which would lead to biases in our understanding of this species space-use and habitat selection. Although these methods identified some general spatial-temporal patterns, dBBMMs were more efficient at detecting movement corridors and accurately representing long-term shelters sites, showing an improvement over methods traditionally favored in reptile studies. The additional flexibility of the dBBMM approach in providing insight into movement patterns can help further improve conservation and management actions. Additionally, our results suggest that dBBMMs may be more widely applicable in studies that rely on VHF telemetry and not limited to studies employing GPS tags.","Silva, Ines

"savedrecs (30).txt","The widespread use of molecular-level motion in key natural processes suggests that great rewards could come from bridging the gap between the present generation of synthetic molecular machines-which by and large function as switches-and the machines of the macroscopic world, which utilize the synchronized behavior of integrated components to perform more sophisticated tasks than is possible with any individual switch. Should we try to make molecular machines of greater complexity by trying to mimic machines from the macroscopic world or instead apply unfamiliar (and no doubt have to discover or invent currently unknown) mechanisms utilized by biological machines? Here we try to answer that question by exploring some of the advances made to date using bio-inspired machine mechanisms.","Zhang, Liang

"savedrecs (30).txt","Roads can affect animals in several ways, by affecting movement, space use, foraging behavior and mortality. As roads often have a negative effect on populations of birds and mammals, their effects are important for wildlife management. However, the effect of roads differ between different types of roads, and most studies of road ecology have focused on major roads with high traffic intensity, whilst effects of smaller unpaved forest roads in northern ecosystems are less known. We investigated the effects of forest roads in a mixed conifer forest in central Europe on cervid habitat use and browsing impact on forest regeneration during the winter season. We found that hunted cervid species avoided forest roads, and that browsing pressure was higher within the core of forest areas rather than close to roads. This led to an increased density of undamaged trees (by browsing) close to forest roads, whilst browsing damages were relatively high in the interior. Hunters often use these forest roads in the hunting season. We suggest that human disturbance creates corridors of fear along forest roads, and that cervids alter their habitat and browse use to avoid humans. This in turn has implications for forest and cervid management. This is the first study to document that gravel roads can affect oak trees through modifying cervid behavior. Future studies should use experiments to explore this question further and separate different effects of forest roads to understand the mechanisms; edge effects on vegetation, traffic, effects on natural predators and human disturbance.","Mathisen, Karen Marie

"savedrecs (30).txt","Use of taxi vehicles as mobile sensors to collect traffic information has become an important and emerging approach to relieve congestion. Global Positioning System (GPS) trajectory data allow for abundant temporal and spatial information to be collected that reflect the mobility and activity of drivers. In this paper, we present a probabilistic model to predict driving trip paths based on a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The first step in our approach was to detect the stays or destinations by using an improved algorithm based on taxi status information about whether or not the vehicle is occupied by passengers. Next, the trips between two stays were extracted and expressed as data chains for applying the learning scheme in a predictive model. A data-driven approach based on an HMM was trained with trips from a period of three months and then the model was used to predict the future links on which the vehicle may travel. A Linear Motion Function (LMF) was then utilized to infer the taxi position on the predicted link. Furthermore, a learning algorithm was used to identify incorrect links for a given path. Finally, the effectiveness of the improved model was tested. In the testing process, samples that contained different trips with different taxi statuses (i.e., occupied and non-occupied) were considered, and the Relative Accuracy (RA) was applied as a measure of effectiveness to evaluate prediction performance. The prediction results verified that the proposed method is an accurate and feasible potential approach that can be used to estimate driving paths in future time periods. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Knowledge on whereabouts within the annual cycle of migratory species is prerequisite for many aspects in ecology and biological conservation. Spatial assignments of stable isotopes archived in tissues allows for later inference on sites where the specific tissue had been grown. It has been rarely tested whether spatial assignments match directly tracked non-breeding residences, especially for migratory songbirds. We here compare assignments of stable isotopes from feathers of Palaearctic Barn swallows Hirundo rustica with their African non-breeding residence sites tracked by geolocation.Assignments based on delta H-2, delta C-13 and delta N-15 isotope compositions delineate three main non-breeding regions: a main cluster in central Africa, a second in West Africa, and the third cluster in Northern Africa. Using delta C-13, delta N-15 only, non-breeding sites ranged from clusters in West/Southwest Africa to South East Africa with a centre in Central Africa. The non-breeding areas (50% and 75% Kernel density estimates, KDE) of the birds tracked by geolocation stretched from West Africa via central Africa to southern Africa. We found little overlap of 0.3% (assuming a 1:1 odds ratio) to 1.4% (3:1 odds ratio) in the three element assignments and KDEs for only 2 and 13 individuals out of 32 birds. Assignment maps for two elements (delta C-13,delta N-15) and KDEs showed higher consistencies with an overlap of 3.6 and 8.5% for 12 and 18 birds. We argue that the low matching between stable isotope assignments and non-breeding sites in our study arise from insufficient baseline data for Africa (concerning both isoscapes and specific discrimination functions). However, other factors like aerial foraging habit of the species, and a potential mismatch of non-breeding site location and the spatial origin of aerial plankton might further hamper accurate assignments. Finally we call for concerted analyses of tissues i.e. feathers and claws of birds which are grown at known sites across the continent and from species with various ecological requirements (diverse habitats, foraging behaviours, and diet compositions) to establish isoscapes for general applicability.","Seifert, Nina

"savedrecs (30).txt","The rate at which animals ingest food is a fundamental part of animal ecology although it is rarely quantified, with recently-developed animal-attached tags providing a potentially viable approach. However, to date, these methods lack clarity in differentiating various eating behaviours, such as 'chewing' from 'biting'. The aims of this study were to examine the use of inter-mandibular angle sensors (IMASENs), to quantify grazing behaviour in herbivores including cattle (Bos taurus), sheep (Ovis aries) and pygmy goats (Capra aegagrus hircus) eating different foodstuffs. Specifically, we aimed to: (1) quantify jaw movements of each species and determine differences between biting and chewing; (2) assess whether different food types can be discerned from jaw movements; and (3) determine whether species-specific differences in jaw movements can be detected. Subjects were filmed while consuming concentrate, hay, grass and browse to allow comparison of observed and IMASEN-recorded jaw movements. This study shows that IMASENs can accurately detect jaw movements of feeding herbivores, and, based on the rate of jaw movements, can classify biting (taking new material into the mouth) from chewing (masticating material already in the mouth). The biting behaviours associated with concentrate pellets could be identified easily as these occurred at the fastest rate for all species. However, the rates of chewing different food items were more difficult to discern from one another. Comparison of chew:bite ratios of the various food types eaten by each species showed no differences. Species differences could be identified using bite and chew rates. Cattle consistently displayed slower bite and chew rates to sheep and pygmy goats when feeding, while sheep and pygmy goats showed similar bite and chew rates when feeding on concentrate pellets. Species-specific differences in chew:bite ratios were not identified. Magnetometry has the potential to record quantitative aspects of foraging such as the feeding duration, food handling time and food type. This is of major importance for researchers interested in both captive (e.g., agricultural productivity) and wild animal foraging dynamics as it can provide quantitative data with minimal observer interference.","Mulvenna, Christina C.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Thousands of species migrate [1]. Though we have some understanding of where and when they travel, we still have very little insight into who migrates with whom and for how long. Group formation is pivotal in allowing individuals to interact, transfer information, and adapt to changing conditions [2]. Yet it is remarkably difficult to infer group membership in migrating animals without being able to directly observe them. Here, we use novel lightweight atmospheric pressure loggers to monitor group dynamics in a small migratory bird, the European bee-eater (Merops apiaster). We present the first evidence of a migratory bird flying together with non-kin of different ages and sexes at all stages of the life cycle. In fact, 49% stay together throughout the annual cycle, never separating longer than 5 days at a time despite the similar to 14,000-km journey. Of those that separated for longer, 89% reunited within less than a month with individuals they had previously spent time with, having flown up to 5,000 km apart. These birds were not only using the same non-breeding sites, but also displayed coordinated foraging behaviors these are unlikely to result from chance encounters in response to the same environmental conditions alone. Better understanding of migratory group dynamics, using the presented methods, could help improve our understanding of collective decision making during largescale movements.","Dhanjal-Adams, Kiran L.

"savedrecs (30).txt","The ability to recover one's bearings when lost is a skill that is fundamental for spatial navigation. We review the cognitive and neural mechanisms that underlie this ability, with the aim of linking together previously disparate findings from animal behavior, human psychology, electrophysiology, and cognitive neuroscience. Behavioral work suggests that reorientation involves two key abilities: first, the recovery of a spatial reference frame (a cognitive map) that is appropriate to the current environment; and second, the determination of one's heading and location relative to that reference frame. Electrophysiological recording studies, primarily in rodents, have revealed potential correlates of these operations in place, grid, border/boundary, and head direction cells in the hippocampal formation. Cognitive neuroscience studies, primarily in humans, suggest that the perceptual inputs necessary for these operations are processed by neocortical regions such as the retrosplenial complex, occipital place area and parahippocampal place area, with the retrosplenial complex mediating spatial transformations between the local environment and the recovered spatial reference frame, the occipital place area supporting perception of local boundaries, and the parahippocampal place area processing visual information that is essential for identification of the local spatial context. By combining results across these various literatures, we converge on a unified account of reorientation that bridges the cognitive and neural domains.","Julian, Joshua B.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Echolocating big brown bats fly, orient, forage, and roost in cluttered acoustic environments in which aggregate sound pressure levels can be as intense as 100 to 140 dB SPL, levels that would impair auditory perception in other terrestrial mammals. We showed previously that bats exposed to intense wide-band sound (116 dB SPL) can navigate successfully through dense acoustic clutter. Here, we extend these results by quantifying performance of bats navigating through a cluttered scene after exposure to intense band-limited sounds (bandwidths 5-25 kHz, 123 dB SPL). Behavioral performance was not significantly affected by prior sound exposure, with the exception of one bat after exposure to one sound. Even in this outlying case, performance recovered rapidly, by 10 min post-exposure. Temporal patterning of biosonar emissions during successful flights showed that bats maintained their individual strategies for navigating through the cluttered scene before and after exposures. In unsuccessful flights, interpulse intervals were skewed towards shorter values, suggesting a shift in strategy for solving the task rather than a hearing impairment.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Few species are adapted to high latitudes, and many over-winter in milder climates with migrations involving extensive barrier crossings. By escaping extreme conditions for the majority of the year, physiological and behavioural adaptations presumably need to be less pronounced. The snow bunting Plectrophenax nivalis is the most northerly breeding passerine. We tracked the Svalbard population using geolocators to reveal that these individuals not only breed in environmental extremes, but also spend the winters in the severe cold and highly stochastic weather conditions of the Siberian steppe. Migratory strategies appeared to be flexible between individuals and years. However, common wintering grounds in the Asian Western Steppe were identified, where birds could utilise vast crop-and grasslands while enduring low ambient temperatures. The timing of significant long distance movements was consistent among individuals, and the autumn routing of the >1000 km open water flight to Novaya Zemlya incurred favourable wind assistance and lower risk of precipitation, compared to the shorter route between Svalbard and Norway used in spring. Presumably, Svalbard snow buntings are physiologically well-adapted to extreme conditions and their migration, rather being a retreat from physiologically demanding conditions, allows utilisation of an abundance of resources in the Asian Steppe.","Snell, Katherine R.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Evolutionary thanatology benefits from broad taxonomic comparisons of non-human animals' responses to death. Furthermore, exploring the sensory and cognitive bases of these responses promises to allow classification of the underlying mechanisms on a spectrum from phylogenetically ancient to more derived traits. We draw on studies of perception and cognition in invertebrate and vertebrate taxa (with a focus on arthropods, corvids, proboscids, cetaceans and primates) to explore the cues that these animals use to detect life and death in others, and discuss proximate and ultimate drivers behind their capacities to do so. Parallels in thanatological behaviour exhibited by the last four taxa suggest similar sensory-cognitive processing rules for dealing with corpses, the evolution of which may have been driven by complex social environments. Uniting these responses is a phenomenon we term 'animacy detection malfunction', whereupon the corpse, having both animate and inanimate attributes, creates states of fear/curiosity manifested as approach/avoidance behaviours in observers. We suggest that integrating diverse lines of evidence (including the 'uncanny valley' effect originating from the field of robotics) provides a promising way to advance the field, and conclude by proposing avenues for future research.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Suicide is a major public health concern accounting for 800 000 deaths globally each year. Although there have been many advances in understanding suicide risk in recent decades, our ability to predict suicide is no better now than it was 50 years ago. There are many potential explanations for this lack of progress, but the absence, until recently, of comprehensive theoretical models that predict the emergence of suicidal ideation distinct from the transition between suicidal ideation and suicide attempts/suicide is key to this lack of progress. The current article presents the integrated motivational- volitional (IMV) model of suicidal behaviour, one such theoretical model. We propose that defeat and entrapment drive the emergence of suicidal ideation and that a group of factors, entitled volitional moderators (VMs), govern the transition from suicidal ideation to suicidal behaviour. According to the IMV model, VMs include access to the means of suicide, exposure to suicidal behaviour, capability for suicide (fearlessness about death and increased physical pain tolerance), planning, impulsivity, mental imagery and past suicidal behaviour. In this article, we describe the theoretical origins of the IMV model, the key premises underpinning the model, empirical tests of the model and future research directions.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Monumental architecture is a prime indicator of social complexity, because it requires many people to build a conspicuous structure commemorating shared beliefs. Examining monumentality in different environmental and economic settings can reveal diverse reasons for people to form larger social units and express unity through architectural display. In multiple areas of Africa, monumentality developed as mobile herders created large cemeteries and practiced other forms of commemoration. The motives for such behavior in sparsely populated, unpredictable landscapes may differ from well-studied cases of monumentality in predictable environments with sedentary populations. Here we report excavations and ground-penetrating radar surveys at the earliest and most massive monumental site in eastern Africa. Lothagam North Pillar Site was a communal cemetery near Lake Turkana (northwest Kenya) constructed 5,000 years ago by eastern Africa's earliest pastoralists. Inside a platform ringed by boulders, a 119.5-m(2) mortuary cavity accommodated an estimated minimum of 580 individuals. People of diverse ages and both sexes were buried, and ornaments accompanied most individuals. There is no evidence for social stratification. The uncertainties of living on a ""moving frontier"" of early herding-exacerbated by dramatic environmental shifts-may have spurred people to strengthen social networks that could provide information and assistance. Lothagam North Pillar Site would have served as both an arena for interaction and a tangible reminder of shared identity.","Hildebrand, Elisabeth A.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Telemetry-based movement research has become central for learning about the behavior, ecology and conservation of wide-ranging species. Particularly, early telemetry studies were conducted on vultures and condors due to three main reasons: i) these birds capture the curiosity of humans, ii) their large body size allows researchers to deploy large telemetry units, and iii) they are of high conservation concern. This has resulted in a great number of scientific articles that remain scattered throughout the literature. To achieve a more cohesive view of vultures and condors movement behavior, we review all telemetry studies published up to 2017. We first present a descriptive summary of the technical and design characteristics of these studies (e.g. target species, tagging location, number of individuals tagged) and go on to discuss them under a common conceptual framework; the Movement Ecology Paradigm. The articles found (N = 97) were mainly published in the last decade and based on the tagging of individuals from 14 species (61% of the extant species) and 24 countries. Foraging was the most in-depth investigated movement phase (25 studies), with studies covering several species, using both phenomenological and mechanistic approaches and tackling the role of different drivers of movement. In contrast, commuting and natal dispersal phases were only superficially investigated (3 and 8 studies, respectively). Finally, studies dealing with the conservation and management also comprised a large portion of the reviewed articles (24 studies). Telemetry studies have revealed relevant details of vultures and condors movements, with highly accurate measurements of flight energetics and a better understanding of the morphological, physiological and context-dependent drivers that underlie the movement decisions of these birds. However, we also detected several information gaps. We expect this review helps researchers to focus their efforts and funds where more information is needed.","Alarcon, Pablo A. E.

Toucans have been known to forage widely for fruit in fragmented landscapes. Our cameras indicated that they additionally foraged on and near the ground for insects or other animal prey in relatively predator-free forest patches. As key agents of dispersal of large-seeded old-growth trees, toucans and other large frugivores were likely responsible for recruitment of animal-dispersed tree species of mature forest in our experimental plantings, even in stands of wind-dispersed trees or controls where animal-dispersed tree species were not planted.","Davlantes, Jason

"savedrecs (30).txt","Eciton burchellii is a Neotropical army ant that influences the ecology of many associated animal species, including their prey and species that attend the ant's foraging raids. At least 29 bird species are obligate specialists on foraging at army ant raid fronts, and additional species across diverse avian orders follow army ant raids in a facultative manner. These facultative ant-following birds include species of raptors in Accipitriformes, Strigiformes, and Falconiformes. The most frequently documented raptors that follow raids are forest-falcons in the genus Micrastur. Micrastur falcons add a unique type of predation to raids, catching larger arthropod species that would otherwise likely escape the ants, and also prey on small fleeing vertebrates, such as lizards and other ant-following bird species. Here we present an observation of a Collared Forest-falcon (Micrastur semitorquatus) attending an E. b. parvispinum raid and flying toward a Ruddy Woodcreeper (Dendrocincla homochroa) at the raid front, as well as capturing a fleeing snake from the raid front. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a snake falling prey to a raptor at an army ant raid front.","Driver, Robert J.

"savedrecs (30).txt","The twilight feeding migration of fish around a shallow water artificial reef (a shipwreck) was observed by a horizontal-looking, mid-frequency sonar. The sonar operated at frequencies between 1.8 and 3.6 kHz and consisted of a co-located source and horizontal line array deployed at 4 km from the reef. The experiment was conducted in a well-mixed shallow water waveguide which is conducive to characterizing fish aggregations at these distances. Large aggregations of fish were repeatedly seen to emerge rapidly from the shipwreck at dusk, disperse into the surrounding area during the night, and quickly converge back to the shipwreck at dawn. This is a rare, macroscopic observation of an ecologically-important reef fish behavior, delivered at the level of aggregations, instead of individual fish tracks that have been documented previously. The significance of this observation on sonar performance associated with target detection in the presence of fish clutter is discussed based on analyses of echo intensity and statistics. Building on previous studies of long-range fish echoes, this study further substantiates the unique utility of such sonar systems as an ecosystem monitoring tool, and illustrates the importance of considering the impact of the presence of fish on sonar applications.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Background Sprinting is key in the development and final results of competitions in a range of sport disciplines, both individual (e.g., athletics) and team sports. Resisted sled training (RST) might provide an effective training method to improve sprinting, in both the acceleration and the maximum-velocity phases. However, substantial discrepancies exist in the literature regarding the influence of training status and sled load prescription in relation to the specific components of sprint performance to be developed and the phase of sprint.
Objectives Our objectives were to review the state of the current literature on intervention studies that have analyzed the effects of RST on sprint performance in both the acceleration and the maximum-velocity phases in healthy athletes and to establish which RST load characteristics produce the largest improvements in sprint performance.
Methods We performed a literature search in PubMed, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science up to and including 9 January 2018. Peer-reviewed studies were included if they met all the following eligibility criteria: (1) published in a scientific journal; (2) original experimental and longitudinal study; (3) participants were at least recreationally active and towed or pulled the sled while running at maximum intensity; (4) RST was one of the main training methods used; (5) studies identified the load of the sled, distance covered, and sprint time and/ or sprint velocity for both baseline and post-training results; (6) sprint performance was measured using timing gates, radar gun, or stopwatch; (7) published in the English language; and (8) had a quality assessment score > 6 points.
Results A total of 2376 articles were found. After filtering procedures, only 13 studies were included in this meta-analysis. In the included studies, 32 RST groups and 15 control groups were analyzed for sprint time in the different phases and full sprint. Significant improvements were found between baseline and post-training in sprint performance in the acceleration phase (effect size [ES] 0.61; p = 0.0001; standardized mean difference [SMD] 0.57; 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.85 to -0.28) and full sprint (ES 0.36; p = 0.009; SMD 0.38; 95% CI -0.67 to -0.10). However, non-significant improvements were observed between pre- and post-test in sprint time in the maximum-velocity phase (ES 0.27; p = 0.25; SMD 0.18; 95% CI -0.49 to 0.13). Furthermore, studies that included a control group found a non-significant improvement in participants in the RST group compared with the control group, independent of the analyzed phase.
Conclusions RST is an effective method to improve sprint performance, specifically in the early acceleration phase. However, it cannot be said that this method is more effective than the same training without overload. The effect of RST is greatest in recreationally active or trained men who practice team sports such as football or rugby. Moreover, the intensity (load) is not a determinant of sprint performance improvement, but the recommended volume is > 160 m per session, and approximately 2680 m per total training program, with a training frequency of two to three times per week, for at least 6 weeks. Finally, rigid surfaces appear to enhance the effect of RST on sprint performance.","Alcaraz, Pedro E.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Simple Summary Everyday experience shows that getting used to negative events is difficult, whereas positive events are quickly taken for granted. This is relevant for basic questions on how we and other animals deal with emotional events. It has also practical implications because we would like to avoid negative events as much as possible and increase the positive events for animals in our care. Here, we repeatedly treated pairs of piglets with a variety of presumed negative, intermediate and positive events and measured their restlessness as well as the reaction of the autonomic nervous system, while the piglets expected these events. We found limited evidence that the reactions of the piglets changed in a systematic way with more repetitions of the different events. Both our experimental set-up and measurements have been used in similar ways before. Therefore, it is likely that we did not find a consistent pattern because we had not correctly assessed the negativity-positivity of the events used or their intensity from the point of view of the piglets.
Abstract Positive and negative stimuli have asymmetric fitness consequences. Whereas, a missed opportunity may be compensated, an unattended threat can be fatal. This is why it has been hypothesised that habituation to positive stimuli is fast while it may be difficult to habituate to negative stimuli, at least for primary (innate) stimuli. However, learning of secondary stimuli may delay the process of habituation. Here, we tested 64 weaned piglets in pairs. In three phases, lasting one week each, piglets were exposed five times to a stimulus of presumed negative, intermediate, or positive valence. Etho-physiological measurements of heart rate, heart rate variability, and general movement activity were collected during the last 4 min before the confrontation with the stimulus (anticipation phase). We found no consistent effect of the interaction between the valence of the stimuli and the repetition and a main effect of valence on our outcome variables. Therefore, we could neither support the hypothesis that piglets habituate more slowly to secondary positive stimuli than to primary negative stimuli nor that they habituate less to primary negative stimuli when compared with other stimuli. These results could have been caused because stimuli may not have differed in the presumed way, the experimental design may not have been adequate, or the measures were not suitable for detecting habituation to the stimuli. Based on the stimuli used here and their valence that was only presumed, we could not support the hypothesis that the habituation process differs according to the valence of the stimuli.","Henzen, Angela

"savedrecs (30).txt","Language is inherently combinatorial, and parallels of this combinatorial capacity are found in nonhuman systems, with animals combining sounds and calls into larger meaningful structures. However, further analogue examples are central in unveiling the diversity, distribution, and evolutionary drivers of combinatoriality. Here, we provide evidence for internal ""meaning-refining"" acoustic variation within a larger stereotyped signal in pied babblers (Turdoides bicolor). Using acoustic analyses, we demonstrate that males produce 2 long, raucous, ""cry-like"" structures, both starting with a wind-up segment grading into repetitions of A/single-note or AB/double-note motifs. Behavioral observations indicated that, consistent with similarities in their larger stereotyped structure, both variants function overall in recruiting group members during locomotion, but the internal A or AB substructure specifies the ""precise"" form of recruitment, from approaching the caller's announced location to following it over longer distances. Playing back cries from a stationary loudspeaker further supported that the 2 variants elicit different responses, with more individuals approaching the loudspeaker in response to single-note compared with double-note cries. Additionally, despite similarities in overall distance travelled, group movement was only directional for single-note, but undefined for double-note cries. We suggest that the overall structure of the 2 cry variants conveys the same general meaning, with embedded variation refining this meaning. These results further illustrate the variability of generative mechanisms outside of human language and lend support to the hypothesis that combinatorial structuring may have emerged in species with limited or fixed vocal repertoires in order to enhance communicative output.","Engesser, Sabrina

"savedrecs (30).txt","Long-distance migratory birds rely on the acquisition of body stores to fuel their migration and reproduction. Breeding success depends on the amount of body stores acquired prior to migration, which is thought to increase with access to food at the fueling site. Here, we studied how food abundance during fueling affected time budgets and reproductive success. In a regime of plenty, we expected that 1) limitations on food harvesting would become lifted, allowing birds to frequently idle, and 2) birds would reach sufficient fuel loads, such that departure weight would no longer affect reproductive success. Our study system comprised brent geese (Branta b. bernicla) staging on high-quality agricultural pastures. Fueling conditions were assessed by a combination of high-resolution GPS tracking, acceleration-based behavioral classification, thermoregulation modeling, and measurements of food digestibility and excretion rates. Mark-resighting analysis was used to test for correlations between departure weight and offspring recruitment. Our results confirm that birds loafed extensively, actively postponed fueling in early spring, and took frequent digestion pauses, suggesting that traditional time constraints on harvest and fueling rates are absent on modern-day fertilized grasslands. Nonetheless, departure weight remained correlated with recruitment success. The persistence of this correlation after a prolonged stopover with access to abundant high-quality food, suggests that between-individual differences in departure condition are not so much enforced by food quality and availability during stopover, but reflect individual quality and longer-lived life-history traits, such as health status and digestive capacity, which may be developed before the fueling period.","Dokter, Adriaan M.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Broodstock collection and enhancement programs are a widely-used management practice within the Atlantic salmon's (Salmo solar) native range. Wild-origin adult salmon captured as part of these programs experience multiple stressors during their time in hatcheries. However, no studies have assessed the potential consequences of hatchery practices on the physiology (stress and immune states), migratory behaviour, and long-term survival of hatchery-spawned kelts that are subsequently released back to their natal river. To address these knowledge gaps, we obtained blood samples from, and acoustically tagged 30 hatchery-spawned kelts and 31 wild-spawned kelts, originating from endangered populations native to a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in Canada during the autumns of 2014 and 2015. We then tracked individuals for up to two years through their downstream river migration, estuarine residence, ocean entry, and subsequent return as repeat-spawners. Our results indicated that hatchery-spawned kelts showed significantly higher stress levels (elevated plasma cortisol and glucose), as well as potentially altered immune states (increased circulating prostaglandin E-2) in comparison to wild spawned individuals. Behaviourally, hatchery-spawned kelts exited freshwater prematurely (similar to 66 days earlier on average) compared to wild-spawned counterparts, which was associated with a marked increase in estuarine mortality. Furthermore, survival to repeat-spawning was 0% (0/30) for hatchery-spawned kelts and 6.5% (2/31) for wild-spawned. Given that female repeat-spawners are generally larger and have increased fecundity, our findings suggest that a reduction in the fitness of post-spawners and likelihood of repeat-spawning as a result of hatchery stressors could have population-level consequences. Such impacts should be considered in conservation and management planning.","Bordeleau, X.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Understanding the large-scale migrations of marine predators can allow better representation of their population dynamics. The migration biology of dusky sharks (Carcharhinus obscurus), a cosmopolitan large marine predator with very low resilience to fishing, was quantified using a large-scale network of acoustic receivers deployed across Western Australia. Time-series plotting of individual shark detections and modified logistic modelling were used to determine the timing of acoustically tagged sharks' seasonal migration, the proportion of the population migrating, and the size at which sharks start to migrate. Large (> 200 cm fork length) dusky sharks migrated between areas closed (north) and open (south) to commercial shark fishing. There was limited evidence that smaller sharks occurred in the northern study area, whereas several larger individuals of both sexes undertook repeated north-south displacements, moving between disparate ecosystems within the Indian Ocean (21.7 degrees S-35.4 degrees S) and covering round-trip distances of 2000-3000 km per migratory event. For migrating individuals, the probability of occurring in the north was high in the austral winter-spring and low (males) to moderate (females) during the austral summer-autumn.","Braccini, Matias

"savedrecs (30).txt","Predators directly impact prey populations through lethal encounters, but understanding nonlethal, indirect effects is also critical because foraging animals often face trade-offs between predator avoidance and energy intake. Quantifying these indirect effects can be difficult even when it is possible to monitor individuals that regularly interact. Our goal was to understand how movement and resource selection of a predator (wolves; Canis lupus) influence the movement behavior of a prey species (moose; Alces alces). We tested whether moose avoided areas with high predicted wolf resource use in two study areas with differing prey compositions, whether avoidance patterns varied seasonally, and whether daily activity budgets of moose and wolves aligned temporally. We deployed GPS collars on both species at two sites in northern Minnesota. We created seasonal resource selection functions (RSF) for wolves and modeled the relationship between moose first-passage time (FPT), a method that discerns alterations in movement rates, and wolf RSF values. Larger FPT values suggest rest/foraging, whereas shorter FPT values indicate travel/fleeing. We found that the movements of moose and wolves peaked at similar times of day in both study areas. Moose FPTs were 45% lower in areas most selected for by wolves relative to those avoided. The relationship between wolf RSF and moose FPT was nonlinear and varied seasonally. Differences in FPT between low and high RSF values were greatest in winter (-82.1%) and spring (-57.6%) in northeastern Minnesota and similar for all seasons in the Voyageurs National Park ecosystem. In northeastern Minnesota, where moose comprise a larger percentage of wolf diet, the relationship between moose FPT and wolf RSF was more pronounced (ave. across seasons: -60.1%) than the Voyageurs National Park ecosystem (-30.4%). These findings highlight the role wolves can play in determining moose behavior, whereby moose spend less time in areas with higher predicted likelihood of wolf resource selection.","Ditmer, Mark A.

"savedrecs (30).txt","The interactions between animals and their environment vary across species, regions, but also with gender. Sex-specific relations between individuals and the ecosystem may entail different behavioral choices and be expressed through different patterns of habitat use. Regardless, only rarely sex-specific traits are addressed in ecological modeling approaches. The European wildcat (Felis silvestris silvestris) is a species of conservation concern in Europe, with a highly fragmented and declining distribution across most of its range. We assessed sex-specific habitat selection patterns for the European wildcat, at the landscape and home range levels, across its Iberian biogeographic distribution using a multipopulation approach. We developed resource selection functions in a use-availability framework using radio-telemetry data from five wildcat populations. At the landscape level, we observed that, while both genders preferentially established home ranges in areas close to broadleaf forests and far from humanized areas, females selected mid-range elevation areas with some topographic complexity, whereas males used lowland areas. At the home range level, both females and males selected areas dominated by scrublands or broadleaf forests, but habitat features were less important at this level. The strength of association to habitat features was higher for females at both spatial levels, suggesting a tendency to select habitats with higher quality that can grant them enhanced access to shelter and feeding resources. Based on our results, we hypothesize that sex-biased behavioral patterns may contribute to the resilience of wildcats' genetic integrity through influencing the directionality of hybridization with domestic cats. Our study provides information about European wildcats' habitat use in an Iberian context, relevant for the implementation of conservation plans, and highlights the ecological relevance of considering sex-related differences in environmental preferences.","Oliveira, Teresa

"savedrecs (30).txt","1. Characterising the spatiotemporal variation of animal behaviour can elucidate the way individuals interact with their environment and allocate energy. Increasing sophistication of tracking technologies paired with novel analytical approaches allows the characterisation of movement dynamics even when an individual is not directly observable.
2. In this study, high-resolution movement data collected via global positioning system (GPS) tracking in three dimensions were paired with topographical information and used in a Bayesian state-space model to describe the flight modes of migrating golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) in eastern North America.
3. Our model identified five functional behavioural states, two of which were previously undescribed variations on thermal soaring. The other states comprised gliding, perching and orographic soaring. States were discriminated by movement features in the horizontal (step length and turning angle) and vertical (change in altitude) planes and by the association with ridgelines promoting wind deflection. Tracked eagles spent 2%, 31%, 38%, 9% and 20% of their daytime in directed thermal soaring, gliding, convoluted thermal soaring, perching and orographic soaring, respectively. The analysis of the relative occurrence of these flight modes highlighted yearly, seasonal, age, individual and sex differences in flight strategy and performance. Particularly, less energy-efficient orographic soaring was more frequent in autumn, when thermals were less available. Adult birds were also better at optimising energy efficiency than subadults.
4. Our approach represents the first example of a state-space model for bird flight mode using altitude data in conjunction with horizontal locations and is applicable to other flying organisms where similar data are available. The ability to describe animal movements in a three-dimensional habitat is critical to advance our understanding of the functional processes driving animals' decisions.","Pirotta, Enrico

"savedrecs (30).txt","Although growing evidence supports the idea that animal personality can explain plasticity in response to changes in the social environment, it remains to be tested whether it can explain spatial responses of individuals in the face of natural environmental fluctuations. This is a major challenge in ecology and evolution as spatial dynamics link individual- and population-level processes. In this study, we investigated the potential of individual personalities to predict differences in fish behaviour in the wild. Specifically, our goal was to answer if individual differences in plasticity of space use to sea surface temperature could be explained by differences in personality along the reactive-proactive axis. To address this question, we first conducted repeated standard laboratory assays (i.e., open-field test, novel object test and mirror stimulation test) to assess the personality type of 76 wild-caught Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). Next, we released the fish back into the sea and monitored their spatial behaviour over large temporal (16months) and spatial (a whole fjord) scales, using high-resolution acoustic tracking. We demonstrate that (a) cod personality traits are structured into a proactive-reactive syndrome (proactive fish being more bold, exploratory and aggressive), (b) mean depth use of individuals is mainly driven by sea temperature and (c) personality is a significant predictor of home range changes in the wild, where reactive, but not proactive, individuals reduced their home range as sea temperature increased. These findings expand our understanding of the ecological consequences of animal personality and the mechanisms shaping spatial dynamics of animals in nature.","Villegas-Rios, David

"savedrecs (30).txt","The aquatic specializations of phocid seals have restricted their ability to locomote on land. The amphibious northern elephant seal, Mirounga angustirostris, is the second largest phocid seal in the world, with males reaching 2700 kg. Although elephant seals are proficient swimmers and deep divers, their extreme size and aquatic specializations limit terrestrial movement. The kinematics of terrestrial locomotion in northern elephant seals were analyzed from video recordings of animals observed on the beach of Ano Nuevo State Reserve, CA, USA. The seals moved using a series of rhythmic undulations produced by dorsoventral spinal flexion. The traveling spinal wave moved anteriorly along the dorsal margin of the body with the chest, pelvic region and foreflippers serving as the main points of contact with the ground. The hindflippers were not used. The spinal wave and foreflippers were used to lift the chest off the ground as the body was pushed forward from the pelvis as the foreflippers were retracted to pull the body forward. Seals moved over land at 0.41-2.56 m s( -1) (0.12-0.71 body lengths s(-1)). The frequency and amplitude of spinal flexions both displayed a direct increase with increasing speed. The duty factor for the pelvic region decreased with increasing velocity while the duty factor of the foreflipper remained constant. Kinematic data for elephant seals and other phocids were used in a biomechanical model to calculate the mechanical energy expended during terrestrial locomotion. The elephant seals were found to expend more energy when traveling over land for their size than smaller phocids. The unique method of terrestrial movement also exhibited greater energy expenditure on land than values for large quadrupeds. The trade-off for the northern elephant seal is that its massive size and morphology have well adapted it to an aquatic existence but limited its locomotor performance (i.e. speed, endurance) on land.","Tennett, Kelsey A.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Foraging and nest relocation forming a bi-directional traffic of outbound and inbound individuals in one-lane organization are two main activities in an ant's life. In this paper, we conducted an experiment on nest relocation of loaded and unloaded ants, moving back and forth between the old nest and the new one. In the experiment, we observed both uni- and bi-directional traffic flow. The headway-speed relationships indicate that the ants showed the same sensitivity to the distance headway in the two types of flow. For bi-directional traffic flow, head-on encounters and giving-way behavior between ants moving in opposing directions were a common occurrence. It took one unloaded ant 2.61 s to solve a head-on encounter with another unloaded ant. Compared with unloaded ants, loaded ants had a lower moving speed, but were less likely to be impacted by a head-on encounter. In the observation region, both sudden stop and head-on encounters contained two phases: deceleration and acceleration. Our analysis indicates that the relaxation time in the deceleration process is less than that in the acceleration process. The reduction of movement efficiency of encountering two discontinuous ants is larger than that when encountering two successive ants (0.18). This is owing to the absence of head-on encounters with following ants. The bi-directional traffic of ants under experimental conditions investigated in this study may inform future studies of high-efficiency movement in collective behavior and traffic systems.","Wang, Qiao

"savedrecs (30).txt","White-tailed sea eagles (Haliaeetus albicilla) exhibit one of the highest mortality rates at wind power plants (WPPs) among raptor species in Europe, but data on circumstances of collision and behavioral response to WPPs are scarce. We analyzed the effect of WPPs on movement patterns of sea eagles in Germany with satellite telemetry. We analyzed ranging behavior and environmental parameters that influence the behavioral flight response to WPPs using multiple regression models. During 2003 through 2009 we radio-tracked 25 white-tailed sea eagles in northern Germany (8 territorial, 7 non-territorial, 10 young eagles marked as nestlings). Mean home range sizes of territorial eagles varied with individuals tracked and the estimation method applied, ranging from 2.7km(2) to 669.7km(2). Sex or breeding status did not influence home range size. Ranging behavior varied between individuals and was correlated with habitat quality (i.e., nest distance to nearest water source and to anthropgogenic structure) and weather conditions. Among the 9 territorial eagles, only 1 individual resided within the officially proposed 3-km minimum safety distance between nest and planned WPP. However, others frequently moved >3km away from their nests, leaving the proposed safety area. One eagle inhabiting a territory within intensively cultivated landscape frequently approached a WPP and did not alter its movement patterns near the WPP compared to control areas. We identified several features visited by the eagles (e.g., perches, small lakes). To mitigate the collision risk of eagles, the recommended safety radius of 3km between nest and WPP should become an international standard with a safe flight corridor to feeding grounds. To avoid frequent collisions at the population scale with WPPs, it is important to construct WPPs only outside the main distribution areas of white-tailed sea eagles. (c) 2018 The Wildlife Society.

"savedrecs (30).txt","The Northern Plains sacred langurs are characterized by their ability to adapt to a variety of habitats. We compared activity budgets of two langur groups, one living in the rural area and the other in the center of Keshabpur town. Data was collected from September, 2012 to August, 2013 through continuous focal animal sampling. Types of different food items and its availability in two habitats were mainly responsible for the variations in activity budgets. We found time spent feeding and resting were significantly higher in the urban group whereas, langurs of the rural group spent more time in moving. There were no significant differences in time spent on grooming and other social interactions. Seasonal variations in all major behaviors were significantly affected by groups. Langurs of both groups spent greater time on feeding and resting in the winter than other seasons while moving was at its peak in the summer. Females spent more time in grooming than males while males spent more time in vigilance and interaction than females. The langurs showed a considerable behavioral plasticity in response to variation of habitat and resources, and the knowledge of these differences is important for the conservation and management of this species.","Khatun, Mst.

"savedrecs (30).txt","The impact of seismic surveys on the catchability of marine fish is a contentious issue, with some claims that seismic surveys may negatively affect catch rates. However little empirical evidence exists to quantify the impacts or identify the mechanisms of such impact. In this study, we used a 2-D seismic survey in the Gippsland Basin, Bass Strait, Australia in April 2015 as an opportunity to quantify fish behaviour (field-based) and commercial fisheries catch (desktop study) across the region before and after airgun operations. Three species found in abundance (gummy shark, swell shark, tiger flathead) were acoustically tagged and released within one of two acoustic arrays (experimental and control zone) and monitored before, during and after the seismic survey. In the field study, only 35% of the gummy sharks and 30% of the swell sharks were subsequently detected two days after release, suggesting movement outside the study area. Various tagged individuals returned sporadically over the monitoring period, including during the seismic survey operations. Behaviour consistent with a possible response to the seismic survey operations was observed for flathead which increased their swimming speed during the seismic survey period and changed their diet movement patterns after the survey. We also investigated the potential impacts of the seismic survey on catch rates using Commonwealth fisheries logbook data from Jan 2012-Oct 2015. Fifteen species and two gear types (Danish seine, gillnet) were modelled to examine differences in catch rates before and after the seismic survey. The catch rates in the six months following the seismic survey were significantly different than predicted in nine out of the 15 species examined, with six species (tiger flathead, goatfish, elephantfish, boarfish, broadnose shark and school shark) showing increases in catch following the seismic survey, and three species (gummy shark, red gurnard, and sawshark) showing reductions. With the exception of flathead movement, we found little evidence for consistent behavioural or catch rate changes induced by the seismic survey in the targeted species, although behavioural data were limited because many sharks left the acoustic receiver array prior to the commencement of the seismic survey.","Bruce, Barry

"savedrecs (30).txt","Environmental changes often affect the persistence of species or populations at different spatial and temporal scales. Thus, species must either adapt to these changes or experience negative impacts at the individual or population levels. Southern Rockhopper Penguins Eudyptes chrysocome are distributed throughout the Southern Ocean and have experienced substantial declines in the past which were linked to various anthropogenic and environmental factors. The aim of this study was to investigate the foraging behavior of male Southern Rockhopper Penguins at Berkeley Sound, East Falkland, Falkland/Malvinas Islands, during incubation, a period at-sea which is crucial for replenishing body condition between two extended fasting periods ashore. Thus, birds are forced to forage efficiently during that time to balance their energy demands. We linked their at-sea distribution and foraging behavior to satellite-derived sea surface temperatures and temperature-depth profiles which were recorded by devices attached to the birds. While Southern Rockhopper Penguins usually travel several hundreds of km out into the open sea on multiple-day trips during incubation, we found in our study that most birds foraged close inshore, less than 9 km away from their colony, and regularly returned to their breeding site. We propose that this behavior occurred in response to the close proximity of the 8 degrees C SST isotherm and the vertical stratification of the waters therein. Also, while usually feeding pelagically in open waters, there are strong indications that Southern Rockhopper Penguins performed benthic or, at least, near-bottom dives to catch their prey during these short trips. The consequences of this behavioral plasticity in response to variations in sea temperatures and inferred prey availability are discussed, especially with regard to predicted global climate change.","Puetz, Klemens

"savedrecs (30).txt","Wearable inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors are powerful enablers for acquisition of motion data. Specifically, in human activity recognition (HAR), IMU sensor data collected from human motion are categorically combined to formulate datasets that can be used for learning human activities. However, successful learning of human activities from motion data involves the design and use of proper feature representations of IMU sensor data and suitable classifiers. Furthermore, the scarcity of labelled data is an impeding factor in the process of understanding the performance capabilities of data-driven learning models. To tackle these challenges, two primary contributions are in this article: first; by using raw IMU sensor data, a spectrogram-based feature extraction approach is proposed. Second, an ensemble of data augmentations in feature space is proposed to take care of the data scarcity problem. Performance tests were conducted on a deep long term short term memory (LSTM) neural network architecture to explore the influence of feature representations and the augmentations on activity recognition accuracy. The proposed feature extraction approach combined with the data augmentation ensemble produces state-of-the-art accuracy results in HAR. A performance evaluation of each augmentation approach is performed to show the influence on classification accuracy. Finally, in addition to using our own dataset, the proposed data augmentation technique is evaluated against the University of California, Irvine (UCI) public online HAR dataset and yields state-of-the-art accuracy results at various learning rates.","Eyobu, Odongo Steven

"savedrecs (30).txt","Cerebellar Ataxia (CA) leads to deficiencies in muscle movement and lack of coordination that is often manifested as gait and balance disabilities. Conventional CA clinical assessments are subjective, cumbersome and provide less insight into the functional capabilities of patients. This cross-sectional study investigates the use of wearable inertial sensors strategically positioned on the front-chest and upper-back locations during the Romberg and Trunk tests for objective assessment of human postural balance due to CA. The primary aim of this paper is to quantify the performance of postural stability of 34 patients diagnosed with CA and 22 healthy subjects as controls. Several forms of entropy descriptions were considered to uncover characteristics of movements intrinsic to CA. Indeed, correlation with clinical observation is vital in ascertaining the validity of the inertial measurements in addition to capturing unique features of movements not typically observed by the practicing clinician. Both of these aspects form an integral part of the underlying objective assessment scheme. Uncertainty in the velocity contained a significant level of information with respect to truncal instability and, based on an extensive clustering and discrimination analysis, fuzzy entropy was identified as an effective measure in characterising the underlying disability. Front-chest measurements demonstrated a strong correlation with clinical assessments while the upper-back measurements performed better in classifying the two cohorts, inferring that the standard clinical assessments are relatively influenced by the frontal observations. The Romberg test was confirmed to be an effective test of neurological diagnosis as well as a potential candidate for objective assessment resulting in a significant correlation with the clinical assessments. In contrast, the Trunk test is observed to be relatively less informative.","Nhan Nguyen

"savedrecs (30).txt","Accelerometry-derived exercise dose (intensity x duration) was assessed throughout a competitive basketball season. Nine elite basketballers wore accelerometers during a Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test (Yo-Yo-IR1) and during three two-week blocks of training that represented phases of the season defined as easy, medium, and hard based on difficulty of match schedule. Exercise dose was determined using accumulated impulse (accelerometry-derived average net force x duration). Relative exercise intensity was quantified using linear relationships between average net force and oxygen consumption during the Yo-Yo-IR1. Time spent in different intensity zones was computed. Influences of match schedule difficulty and playing position were evaluated. Exercise dose reduced for recovery and pre-match tapering sessions during the medium match schedule. Exercise dose did not vary during the hard match schedule. Exercise dose was not different between playing positions. The majority of activity during training was spent performing sedentary behaviour or very light intensity activity (64.3 +/- 6.1%). Front-court players performed a greater proportion of very light intensity activity (mean difference: 6.8 +/- 2.8%), whereas back-court players performed more supramaximal intensity activity (mean difference: 4.5 +/- 1.0%). No positional differences existed in the proportion of time in all other intensity zones. Objective evaluation of exercise dose might allow coaches to better prescribe and monitor the demands of basketball training.","Staunton, Craig

"savedrecs (30).txt","Predator-prey interactions are central to fitness as animals simultaneously avoid death and consume resources to ensure growth and reproduction. Along with direct effects, predators can also exert strong non-consumptive effects. For example, prey shift habitat use in the presence of predators, a potentially learned behavior. The impact of cognition on movement and predator interactions is largely unexplored despite evidence of learned responses to predation threat. We explore how learning and spatial memory influence predator-prey dynamics by introducing predators into a memory-driven movement modeling framework. To model various aspects of risk, we vary predator behavior: their persistence and spatial correlation with the prey's resources. Memory outperforms simpler movement processes most in patchy environments with more predictable predators that are more easily avoided once learned. In these cases, memory aids foragers in managing the food- safety trade-off. For example, particular parameterizations of the predation memory reduce encounters while maintaining consumption. We found that non-consumptive effects are highest in landscapes of concentrated, patchy resources. These effects are intensified when predators are highly correlated with the forager's resources. Smooth landscapes provide more opportunities for foragers to simultaneously consume resources and avoid predators. Predators are able to effectively guard all resources in very patchy landscapes. These non-consumptive effects are also seen with the shift away from the best quality habitat compared to foraging in a predator-free environment.","Bracis, Chloe

"savedrecs (30).txt","Context. Accurate estimates of population density are a critical component of effective wildlife conservation and management. However, many snake species are so secretive that their density cannot be determined using traditional methods such as capture-mark-recapture. Thus, the status of most terrestrial snake populations remains completely unknown.
Aim. We developed a novel simulation-based technique for estimating density of secretive snakes that combined behavioural observations of snake road-crossing behaviour (crossing speed), effort-corrected road-survey data, and simulations of spatial movement patterns derived from radio-telemetry, without relying on mark recapture.
Methods. We used radio-telemetry data to parameterise individual-based movement models that estimate the frequency with which individual snakes cross roads and used information on survey vehicle speed and snake crossing speed to determine the probability of detecting a snake, given that it crosses the road transect during a survey. Snake encounter frequencies during systematic road surveys were then interpreted in light of detection probabilities and simulation model results to estimate snake densities and to assess various factors likely to affect abundance estimates. We demonstrated the broad applicability of this approach through a case study of the imperiled southern hognose snake (Heterodon simus) in the North Carolina (USA) Sandhills.
Key results. We estimated that H. simus occurs at average densities of 0.17 ha(-1) in the North Carolina Sandhills and explored the sensitivity of this estimate to assumptions and variation in model parameters.
Conclusions. Our novel method allowed us to generate the first abundance estimates for H. simus. We found that H. simus exists at low densities relative to congeners and other mid-sized snake species, raising concern that this species may not only have declined in geographic range, but may also occur at low densities or be declining in their strongholds, such as the North Carolina Sandhills.","Willson, John A.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Seabirds and fisheries have been interacting from ancient times, sometimes with mutual benefits: Seabirds provided fishermen with visual cues of fish aggregations, and also fed upon food subsids generated by fishing activities. Yet fisheries and seabirds may also compete for the same resources, and their interactions can lead to additional seabird mortality through accidental bycatch and diminishing fishing efficiency, threatening vulnerable seabird populations. Understanding these complex relationships is essential for conservation strategies, also because it could enhance and ease discussion between stakeholders, towards a common vision for marine ecosystem management. As an aid in this process, we reviewed 510 scientific publications dedicated to seabirds-fisheries interactions, and compiled a methodological toolkit. Methods employed therein serve four main purposes: (i) Implementing distribution overlap analyses, to highlight areas of encounter between seabirds and fisheries (ii) Analysing movement and behavioural patterns using finer-scale information, to characterize interaction types (iii) Investigating individual-scale feeding ecology, to assess fisheries impacts at the scale of bird populations, and (iv) Quantifying the impacts of seabird-fishery interactions on seabird demography and population trends. This latter step allows determining thresholds and tipping points with respect to ecological sustainability. Overall, we stress that forthcoming studies should integrate those multiple approaches, in order to identify and promote best practices towards ecosystem-based fisheries management and ecologically sound marine spatial planning.","Le Bot, Tangi

"savedrecs (30).txt","From 2005 to 2010, 136 internal archival tags and 29 pop-up satellite archival tags were used to track juvenile Atlantic bluefin tuna in the Bay of Biscay. Information from 15 pop-up and 5 internal archival tags was recovered. The analysis was adapted for a common treatment of both types of tag data, allowing classification of overwintering distribution patterns, fidelity to the Bay of Biscay feeding area, as well as of horizontal and vertical habitat utilization. Results show substantial geographic dispersion from autumn to spring, with high habitat concentration in the Bay of Biscay during summer, when bluefin tuna inhabit in the mixed layer. Of the individuals that left the Bay of Biscay towards the end of the year, a high percentage returned the next year, suggesting a strong fidelity to the area. Thirty-three percent of records during the overwintering periods revealed residency in the Bay of Biscay and surrounding areas. Half of the fish overwintered in the mid-Atlantic, near the Azores or Madeira Islands, while three (17%) made trans-Atlantic round trips, and one individual travelled to and remained off the eastern coast of the United States. These findings challenge previous assumptions regarding the seasonality and annual movements of bluefin tuna from the Bay of Biscay, while demonstrating extensive spatio-temporal dispersion.","Arregui, Igor

"savedrecs (30).txt","Identification of pollen vectors is a fundamental objective of pollination biology. The foraging and social behavior of these pollinators has profound effects on plant mating, making quantification of their behavior critical for understanding the ecological and evolutionary consequences of different pollinators for the plants they visit. However, accurate quantification of visitation may be problematic, especially for shy animals and/or when the temporal and spatial scale of observation desired is large. Sophisticated heat- and movement-triggered motion-sensor cameras (camera trapping) provide new, underutilized tools to address these challenges. However, to date, there has been no rigorous evaluation of the sampling considerations needed for using camera trapping in pollination research. We measured the effectiveness of camera trapping for identifying vertebrate visitors and quantifying their visitation rates and foraging behavior on Banksia menziesii (Proteaceae). Multiple still cameras (Reconyx HC 500) and a video camera (Little Acorn LTL5210A) were deployed. From 2,753 recorded visits by vertebrates, we identified five species of nectarivorous honeyeater (Meliphagidae) and the honey possum (Tarsipedidae), with significant variation in the species composition of visitors among inflorescences. Species of floral visitor showed significant variation in their time of peak activity, duration of visits, and numbers of flowers probed per visit. Where multiple cameras were deployed on individual inflorescences, effectiveness of individual still cameras varied from 15% to 86% of all recorded visits. Methodological issues and solutions, and the future uses of camera traps in pollination biology, are discussed.Conclusions and wider implications: Motion-triggered cameras are promising tools for the quantification of vertebrate visitation and some aspects of behavior on flowers. However, researchers need to be mindful of the variation in effectiveness of individual camera traps in detecting animals. Pollinator studies using camera traps are in their infancy, and the full potential of this developing technology is yet to be realized.","Krauss, Siegfried L.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Running biomechanics and its evolution that occurs over intensive trials are widely studied, but few studies have focused on the reproducibility of stride evolution in these runs. The purpose of this investigation was to assess the reproducibility of changes in eight biomechanical variables during exhaustive runs, using three-dimensional analysis. Ten male athletes (age: 23 +/- 4 years; maximal oxygen uptake: 57.5 +/- 4.4 ml0(2).min(-1).kg(-1); maximal aerobic speed: 19.3 +/- 0.8 km.h(-1)) performed a maximal treadmill test. Between 3 to 10 days later, they started a series of three time-to-exhaustion trials at 90% of the individual maximal aerobic speed, seven days apart. During these trials eight biomechanical variables were recorded over a 20-s period every 4 min until exhaustion. The evolution of a variable over a trial was represented as the slope of the linear regression of these variables over time. Reproducibility was assessed with intraclass correlation coefficients and variability was quantified as standard error of measurement. Changes in five variables (swing duration, stride frequency, step length, centre of gravity vertical and lateral amplitude) showed moderate to good reproducibility (0.48 <= ICC <= 0.72), while changes in stance duration, reactivity and foot orientation showed poor reproducibility (-0.71 <= ICC <= 0.04). Fatigue-induced changes in stride biomechanics do not follow a reproducible course across the board; however, several variables do show satisfactory stability: swing duration, stride frequency, step length and centre of gravity shift.","Martens, Geraldine

"savedrecs (30).txt","The aim of the study was to investigate the relationship between tactical performance, somatic maturity, and functional capabilities in young soccer players. Study participants were 48 soccer players (14.80 +/- 1.5 years) belonging to an extension project at the State University of Maringa - Brazil. Anthropometric measurements of body mass, body height, and sitting height were carried out. The number of years to peak height velocity (PHV) was used as an index of maturation. Evaluations of functional fitness included the following tests: sit-and-reach, Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery Test Level 1, handgrip test, modified abdominal test, and vertical jumps (Counter Movement Jump and Jump Squat). Tactical performance was assessed through the System of Tactical Assessment in Soccer (FUT-SAT). Multiple Linear Regression models were used to estimate the relative contributions of functional and maturational capacities to tactical performance. The results indicated weak associations between the tactical performance indices and somatic maturity, functional capacity, and anthropometric attributes (r < 0.40). The Yo-Yo Test contributed to 36% of the defensive tactic performance variation in the under 13 category. These results suggest that the level of maturity, growth status, and functional fitness have limited impact on tactical performance of young soccer players.","Borges, Paulo Henrique

"savedrecs (30).txt","The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of pitch shape modifications on heart rate responses and time-motion characteristics in soccer players during 5-a-side small-sided games (SSGs). Players completed four different SSG dimensions: (1) short narrow pitch (SN; 40 x 25 m), (2) short wide pitch (SW; 66 x 25 m), (3) long narrow pitch (LN; 40 x 50 m), and (4) long wide pitch (LW; 66 x 50 m). Twenty amateur soccer players (age: 21 +/- 5 yr; stature: 176.8 +/- 1.9 cm; body mass: 72.7 +/- 3.7 kg) were monitored using a heart rate monitor and a 10 Hz GPS device. Mean maximum heart rate (% HRmax), rating of perceived exertion (RPE), peak running speed, total distance covered (TD), distance covered in four speed categories, number of moderate and high accelerations (Ac), decelerations (Dc), changes of direction (COD) and player load were recorded. Increasing the pitch length had a greater effect compared to increasing the pitch width especially on RPE (3.8, 6.3, 4.9 and 6.6 AU to SN, LN, SW and LW, respectively) and time-motion characteristics such as TD (101, 127, 108 and 131 m.min(-1) to SN, LN, SW and LW, respectively), peak speed (4.8, 6.1, 5.2 and 6.2 m.s(-1) to SN, LN, SW and LW, respectively), and the number of accelerations, decelerations, and changes of direction. The data demonstrates that increasing the length rather than the width of 5-a-side SSG has a greater impact on players' responses in terms of increasing workloads.","Casamichana, David

"savedrecs (30).txt","To succeed at a sport, athletes must manage the biomechanical trade-offs that constrain their performance. Here, we investigate a previously unknown trade-off in soccer: how the speed of a kick makes the outcome more predictable to an opponent. For this analysis, we focused on penalty kicks to build on previous models of factors that influence scoring. More than 700 participants completed an online survey, watching videos of penalty shots from the perspective of a goalkeeper. Participants (ranging in soccer playing experience from never played to professional) watched 60 penalty kicks, each of which was occluded at a particular moment (-0.4 s to 0.0 s) before the kicker contacted the ball. For each kick, participants had to predict shot direction toward the goal (left or right). As expected, predictions became more accurate as time of occlusion approached ball contact. However, the effect of occlusion was more pronounced when players kicked with the side of the foot than when they kicked with the top of the foot (instep). For side-foot kicks, the direction of shots was predicted more accurately for faster kicks, especially when a large portion of the kicker's approach was presented. Given the trade-off between kicking speed and directional predictability, a penalty kicker might benefit from kicking below their maximal speed.","Hunter, Andrew H.

"savedrecs (30).txt","The aim of this study was to analyze the concurrent validity, test-retest reliability, and capacity to detect changes of four different portable devices used to measure a wide range of neuromuscular parameters derived from countermovement jump (CMJ). An accelerometric device (Myotest), a jump mat (Ergojump), an optical device (Optojump), and a smartphone app (MyJump) were simultaneously examined for concurrent validity against gold-standard measures (motion-capture system and a force platform). Twenty-two CMJ-derived variables were collected from 15 healthy male subjects (n = 60 CMJs). Contraction time (CT) and eccentric duration (EccD) measurements obtained from the Myotest were moderately to largely associated with and not different from force platform measurements (r = 0.31 to 0.64, ES = 0.11 to 0.18) and showed moderate test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.92 to 0.97, coefficient of variation (CV) = 3.8 to 8.0%). Flight time (FT) and jump height (JH) from Ergojump, Optojump, and MyJump showed moderate to strong associations with gold-standard measurements (r = 0.57 to 0.98) and good test-retest reliability (ICC = 0.54 to 0.97, CV = 1.8 to 4.2). However, all portable devices underestimated JH (ES = 1.25 to 2.75). Independent of the instrument used, the analyzed CMJ variables showed good capacity to detect changes (standard error of measurement (SEM) < smallest worthwhile change (SWC)), with the exception of rate of force and rate of power development parameters, which showed marginal capacity (SEM > SWC). The Myotest is preferable to measure temporal parameters during ground contact, whereas Ergojump, Optojump, and MyJump devices may be preferable to measure FT and JH, with the Optojump being the most accurate.","Rago, Vincenzo

"savedrecs (30).txt","The primary purpose of this study was to determine if a difference existed between peak speed attained when performing a sprint with maximal acceleration versus from a gradual build-up. Additionally, this investigation sought to compare the actual peak speed achieved when instructed to reach 75% and 90% of maximum speed. Field sport athletes (n = 21) performed sprints over 60 m under the experimental conditions, and the peak speed was assessed with a radar gun. The gradual build-up to maximum speed (8.30 +/- 0.40 m.s(-1)) produced the greater peak speed (effect size = 0.3, small) than the maximum acceleration run (8.18 +/- 0.40 m.s(-1)), and the majority of participants (62%) followed this pattern. For the sub-maximum runs, the actual mean percentage of maximum speed reached was 78 +/- 6% for the 75% prescribed run and 89 +/- 5% for the 90% prescription. The errors in attaining the prescribed peak speeds were large (similar to similar to 15%) for certain individuals, especially for the 75% trial. Sprint training for maximum speed should be performed with a gradual build-up of speed rather than a maximum acceleration. For sub-maximum interval training, the ability to attain the prescribed target peak speed can be challenging for field sport athletes, and therefore where possible, feedback on peak speeds reached should be provided after each repetition.","Young, Warren B.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Individuals with mobility impairments related to age, injury, or disease, often require the help of an assistive device (AD) such as a cane to ambulate, increase safety, and improve overall stability. Instrumenting these devices has been proposed as a non-invasive way to proactively monitor an individual's reliance on the AD while also obtaining information about behaviors and changes in gait. A critical first step in the analysis of these data, however, is the accurate processing and segmentation of the sensor data to extract relevant gait information. In this paper, we present a highly accurate multi-sensor-based gait segmentation algorithm that is robust to a variety of walking conditions using an AD. A matched filtering approach based on loading information is used in conjunction with an angular rate reversal and peak detection technique, to identify important gait events. The algorithm is tested over a variety of terrains using a hybrid sensorized cane, capable of measuring loading, mobility, and stability information. The reliability and accuracy of the proposed multi-sensor matched filter (MSMF) algorithm is compared with variations of the commonly employed gyroscope peak detection (GPD) algorithm. Results of an experiment with a group of 30 healthy participants walking over various terrains demonstrated the ability of the proposed segmentation algorithm to reliably and accurately segment gait events.","Gill, Satinder

"savedrecs (30).txt","Wearable sensors can provide detailed information on human movement but the clinical impact of this information remains limited. We propose a machine learning approach, using wearable sensor data, to identify subject-specific changes in gait patterns related to improvements in clinical outcomes. Eight patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) completed two gait trials before and one following an exercise intervention. Wearable sensor data (e.g., 3-dimensional (3D) linear accelerations) were collected from a sensor located near the lower back, lateral thigh and lateral shank during level treadmill walking at a preferred speed. Wearable sensor data from the 2 pre-intervention gait trials were used to define each individual's typical movement pattern using a one-class support vector machine (OCSVM). The percentage of strides defined as outliers, based on the pre-intervention gait data and the OCSVM, were used to define the overall change in an individual's movement pattern. The correlation between the change in movement patterns following the intervention (i.e., percentage of outliers) and improvement in self-reported clinical outcomes (e.g., pain and function) was assessed using a Spearman rank correlation. The number of outliers observed post-intervention exhibited a large association ( = 0.78) with improvements in self-reported clinical outcomes. These findings demonstrate a proof-of-concept and a novel methodological approach for integrating machine learning and wearable sensor data. This approach provides an objective and evidence-informed way to understand clinically important changes in human movement patterns in response to exercise therapy.","Kobsar, Dylan

"savedrecs (30).txt","This review provides an overview of unobtrusive monitoring techniques that could be used to monitor some of the human vital signs (i.e., heart activity, breathing activity, temperature and potentially oxygen saturation) in a car seat. It will be shown that many techniques actually measure mechanical displacement, either on the body surface and/or inside the body. However, there are also techniques like capacitive electrocardiogram or bioimpedance that reflect electrical activity or passive electrical properties or thermal properties (infrared thermography). In addition, photopleythysmographic methods depend on optical properties (like scattering and absorption) of biological tissues and-mainly-blood. As all unobtrusive sensing modalities are always fragile and at risk of being contaminated by disturbances (like motion, rapidly changing environmental conditions, triboelectricity), the scope of the paper includes a survey on redundant sensor arrangements. Finally, this review also provides an overview of automotive demonstrators for vital sign monitoring.","Leonhardt, Steffen

"savedrecs (30).txt","Mobile phones are increasingly used for purposes that have nothing to do with phone calls or simple data transfers, and one such use is indoor inertial navigation. Nevertheless, the development of a standalone application able to detect the displacement of the user starting only from the data provided by the most common inertial sensors in the mobile phones (accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer), is a complex task. This complexity lies in the hardware disparity, noise on data, and mostly the many movements that the mobile phone can experience and which have nothing to do with the physical displacement of the owner. In our case, we describe a proposal, which, after using quaternions and a Kalman filter to project the sensors readings into an Earth Centered inertial reference system, combines a classic Peak-valley detector with an ensemble of SVMs (Support Vector Machines) and a standard deviation based classifier. Our proposal is able to identify and filter out those segments of signal that do not correspond to the behavior of ""walking"", and thus achieve a robust detection of the physical displacement and counting of steps. We have performed an extensive experimental validation of our proposal using a dataset with 140 records obtained from 75 different people who were not connected to this research.","Rodriguez, German

"savedrecs (30).txt","A target recognition method of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images is proposed via matching attributed scattering centers (ASCs) to binary target regions. The ASCs extracted from the test image are predicted as binary regions. In detail, each ASC is first transformed to the image domain based on the ASC model. Afterwards, the resulting image is converted to a binary region segmented by a global threshold. All the predicted binary regions of individual ASCs from the test sample are mapped to the binary target regions of the corresponding templates. Then, the matched regions are evaluated by three scores which are combined as a similarity measure via the score-level fusion. In the classification stage, the target label of the test sample is determined according to the fused similarities. The proposed region matching method avoids the conventional ASC matching problem, which involves the assignment of ASC sets. In addition, the predicted regions are more robust than the point features. The Moving and Stationary Target Acquisition and Recognition (MSTAR) dataset is used for performance evaluation in the experiments. According to the experimental results, the method in this study outperforms some traditional methods reported in the literature under several different operating conditions. Under the standard operating condition (SOC), the proposed method achieves very good performance, with an average recognition rate of 98.34%, which is higher than the traditional methods. Moreover, the robustness of the proposed method is also superior to the traditional methods under different extended operating conditions (EOCs), including configuration variants, large depression angle variation, noise contamination, and partial occlusion.","Tan, Jian

"savedrecs (30).txt","Many rural communities are increasingly relying on off-road motorized vehicles to access wildlife for both subsistence harvest and recreational hunting. Understanding the effects of trail and road networks on wildlife behavior is crucial to effective management for subsistence opportunities in communities that depend on accessible populations as an ecosystem service. We collared 26 adult male moose (Alces alces) in interior Alaska to monitor fine-scale habitat selection and movement patterns before, during, and after the hunting season in relation to trail and habitat characteristics. Moose response varied by region and the associated distribution of regional hunter trails (e.g., trails and secondary roads). Moose that resided in areas with extensive trail access selected habitat closer to trails and vegetative cover. Additionally, moose step length increased as distance to cover increased. Moose in more remote, less accessible regions avoided areas with high trail densities and selected habitat closer to quality forage during the hunting season. Moose step lengths also increased with higher densities of trails. Our research suggests that landscape-level hunter access can affect patterns of male moose movement and habitat selection to avoid risk during the hunting season. Our models provide an innovative approach to examining the spatio-temporal variation of behavioral responses to habitat and landscape features and can serve as a framework for managers to better understand the relationships between human disturbance during the hunting season and wildlife management and conservation.","Brown, Casey L.

"savedrecs (30).txt","There is increasing uncertainty of how marine ecosystems will respond to rising temperatures. While studies have focused on the impacts of warming on individual species, knowledge of how species interactions are likely to respond is scant. The strength of even simple two-species interactions is influenced by several interacting mechanisms, each potentially changing with temperature. We used controlled experiments to assess how plan-herbivore interactions respond to temperature for three structural dominant macrophytes in the Mediterranean and their principal sea urchin herbivore. Increasing temperature differentially influenced plant-specific growth, sea urchin growth and metabolism, consumption rates and herbivore preferences, but not movement behaviour. Evaluating these empirical observations against conceptual models of plant-herbivore performance, it appears likely that while the strength of herbivory may increase for the tested macroalga, for the two dominant seagrasses, the interaction strength may remain relatively unchanged or even weaken as temperatures rise. These results show a clear set of winners and losers in the warming Mediterranean as the complex factors driving species interactions change.","Pages, Jordi F.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Gaze behavior offers valuable insights into attention and cognition. However, technological limitations have prevented the examination of animals' gaze behavior in natural, information-rich contexts; for example, during navigation through complex environments. Therefore, we developed a lightweight custom-made logger equipped with an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and GPS to simultaneously track the head movements and flight trajectories of free-flying homing pigeons. Pigeons have a limited range of eye movement, and their eye moves in coordination with their head in a saccadic manner (similar to primate eye saccades). This allows head movement to act as a proxy for visual scanning behavior. Our IMU sensor recorded the 3D movement of the birds' heads in high resolution, allowing us to reliably detect distinct saccade signals. The birds moved their head far more than necessary for maneuvering flight, suggesting that they actively scanned the environment. This movement was predominantly horizontal (yaw) and sideways (roll), allowing them to scan the environment with their lateral visual field. They decreased their head movement when they flew solo over prominent landmarks (major roads and a railway line) and also when they flew in pairs (especially when flying side by side, with the partner maintained in their lateral visual field). Thus, a decrease in head movement indicates a change in birds' focus of attention. We conclude that pigeons use their head gaze in a task-related manner and that tracking flying birds' head movement is a promising method for examining their visual attention during natural tasks.","Kano, Fumihiro

"savedrecs (30).txt","Echolocating bats dynamically adapt the features of their sonar calls as they approach obstacles and track targets. As insectivorous bats forage, they increase sonar call rate with decreasing prey distance, and often embedded in bat insect approach sequences are clusters of sonar sounds, termed sonar sound groups (SSGs). The bat's production of SSGs has been observed in both field and laboratory conditions, and is hypothesized to sharpen spatiotemporal sonar resolution. When insectivorous bats hunt, they may encounter erratically moving prey, which increases the demands on the bat's sonar imaging system. Here, we studied the bat's adaptive vocal behavior in an experimentally controlled insect-tracking task, allowing us to manipulate the predictability of target trajectories and measure the prevalence of SSGs. With this system, we trained bats to remain stationary on a platform and track a moving prey item, whose trajectory was programmed either to approach the bat, or to move back and forth, before arriving at the bat. We manipulated target motion predictability by varying the order in which different target trajectories were presented to the bats. During all trials, we recorded the bat's sonar calls and later analysed the incidence of SSG production during the different target tracking conditions. Our results demonstrate that bats increase the production of SSGs when target unpredictability increases, and decrease the production of SSGs when target motion predictability increases. Furthermore, bats produce the same number of sonar vocalizations irrespective of the target motion predictability, indicating that the animal's temporal clustering of sonar call sequences to produce SSGs is purposeful, and therefore involves sensorimotor planning.","Kothari, Ninad B.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Although many arthropods have the ability to voluntarily lose limbs, how these animals rapidly adapt to such an extreme perturbation remains poorly understood. It is thought that moving with certain gaits can enable efficient, stable locomotion; however, switching gaits requires complex information flow between and coordination of an animal's limbs. We show here that upon losing two legs, spiders can switch to a novel, more statically stable gait, or use temporal adjustments without a gait change. The resulting gaits have higher overall static stability than the gaits that would be imposed by limb loss. By decreasing the time spent in a low-stability configuration - effectively 'limping' over less-stable phases of the stride - spiders increased the overall stability of the less statically stable gait with no observable reduction in speed, as compared with the intact condition. Our results shed light on how voluntary limb loss could have persisted evolutionarily among many animals, and provide bioinspired solutions for robots when they break or lose limbs.","Wilshin, Simon

"savedrecs (30).txt","Agricultural field crops differ in their vegetation height, coverage, and temporal development, affecting the abundances of bird species, which are often used as bioindicators. Although this relationship has been observed, no significant methodology exists to describe the dynamics of field crop growth on a landscape scale in connection with the abundance of indicator bird species that allows meaningful interpretation of bird abundance data with respect to crop vegetation parameters during the breeding season. In a field observation program, we monitored 2,900ha of agricultural landscape to represent both the crop growth processes and the bird abundances. We measured these two parameters in the study area, dominated by winter wheat, winter rapeseed, maize, and fallow fields, and adapted the moving window approach to a new method of moving window growth to describe the dynamic development of height and coverage of the crops over time. Simultaneously, Skylarks (Alauda arvensis) territorial behavior was measured concurrently on the same fields and crops. Their dynamic abundance was documented over the breeding season. To test the relationship between crop growth and development and bird abundance, we applied a generalized linear model (GLM) in two ways: (a) without differentiation of crop species and (b) with differentiation of crop species. We found significant relationships between bird abundance and vegetation height and coverage with respect to both individual parameters and their interactions, even without differentiation of the agricultural crops. In general, increasing vegetation height and coverage, especially the interaction, led to decreasing bird abundance values. The model quality increased significantly by including differentiation of specific crops as an explanatory variable indicating a non-homogenous situation between crops. Separate models for individual crop species revealed larger differences in model quality with best and least goodness of fit values for fallow fields and winter rapeseed, respectively. Because of the clear interactions between bird abundance, type of field crop, and vegetation height and coverage, it follows that both habitat suitability assessments of arable fields and the definition of favorable vegetation structures for farmland birds should be crop species-specific.","Hoffmann, Joerg

"savedrecs (30).txt","The interaction between brown bears (Ursus arctos) and Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) is important to the population dynamics of both species and a celebrated example of consumer-mediated nutrient transport. Yet, much of the site-specific information we have about the bears in this relationship comes from observations at a few highly visible but unrepresentative locations and a small number of radio-telemetry studies. Consequently, our understanding of brown bear abundance and behavior at more cryptic locations where they commonly feed on salmon, including small spawning streams, remains limited. We employed a noninvasive genetic approach (barbed wire hair snares) over four summers (2012-2015) to document patterns of brown bear abundance and movement among six spawning streams for sockeye salmon, O.nerka, in southwestern Alaska. The streams were grouped into two trios on opposite sides of Lake Aleknagik. Thus, we predicted that most bears would forage within only one trio during the spawning season because of the energetic costs associated with swimming between them or traveling around the lake and show fidelity to particular trios across years because of the benefits of familiarity with local salmon dynamics and stream characteristics. Huggins closed-capture models based on encounter histories from genotyped hair samples revealed that as many as 41 individuals visited single streams during the annual 6-week sampling season. Bears also moved freely among trios of streams but rarely moved between these putative foraging neighborhoods, either during or between years. By implication, even small salmon spawning streams can serve as important resources for brown bears, and consistent use of stream neighborhoods by certain bears may play an important role in spatially structuring coastal bear populations. Our findings also underscore the efficacy of noninvasive hair snagging and genetic analysis for examining bear abundance and movements at relatively fine spatial and temporal scales.","Wirsing, Aaron J.

This paper presents an improved methodology of using social media (Twitter) data to extract spatial and temporal patterns of park visits for urban planning purposes, along with the sentiment of the tweets, focusing on frequent Twitter users. We analyzed the spatiotemporal park visiting behavior of more than 4000 users for almost 1700 parks, examining 78,000 tweets in London, UK. The novelty of the research is in the combination of spatial and temporal aspects of Twitter data analysis, applying sentiment and emotion extraction for park visits throughout the whole city. This transferable methodology thereby overcomes many of the limitations of traditional research methods. This study concluded that people tweeted mostly in parks 3-4 km away from their center of activity and they were more positive than elsewhere while doing so. In our analysis, we identified four types of parks based on their visitors' spatial behavioral characteristics, the sentiment of the tweets, and the temporal distribution of the users, serving as input for further urban planning-related investigations.","Kovacs-Gyoeri, Anna

"savedrecs (30).txt","The potential effects of a hydropower scheme on the migratory behaviour of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar smolts was studied on the River Frome, southern England. The potential delay to migration at the intake of the hydropower scheme was assessed, together with the effects of passage through the turbine on the temporal and spatial migration of the fish in the river and estuary. The migratory behaviour of the emigrating S. salar smolts was monitored using miniature acoustic transmitters and an array of acoustic receivers positioned at the hydropower scheme and in the river and estuary. The majority of the smolts bypassed the hydropower scheme with only 8.1% of the fish moving downstream through the turbine. Movement was nocturnal and occurred during elevated river flows. There was no apparent delay at the turbine intake or at the adjacent weir. The subsequent migration of all smolts through the estuary of the River Frome occurred during both day and night and there was a distinct ebb-tide migration through the estuary and into the coastal zone. There was no difference in the rate of migration between smolts that moved through the turbine or over the weir. The detection of smolts during both the freshwater migration and the transition from the freshwater to the marine environments was high (91.8 and 73.3%, respectively). A laboratory investigation on the de-scaling of smolts indicated that removal of 1, 5 and 10% of scales had no significant effect on saltwater survival or the measured physiological parameters (gill Na+-K+-ATPase activity, plasma osmolality and chloride concentrations). Smolt passage through the turbine was assessed and resulted in either no damage to the integument or scale loss or between 20 and 80% of total body area of recaptured smolts. It is estimated that 1.53% of the smolt population would suffer significant damage after passage through the turbine. The implications of the hydropower scheme on the population of salmon in the River Frome are discussed.","Moore, Andy

"savedrecs (30).txt","Off-road vehicles (ORVs) on sandy beaches are highly controversial; they cause ecological harm, but at the same time are popular recreational tools. This juxtaposition constitutes a wicked problem in coastal management. Advancing solutions to this problem will require information on what motivates beach driving and what form it takes. To this end, we tracked off-road vehicles and explored the range of motives and purposes of drivers in the south-eastern part of South Australia. Four user groups were evident based on self-reported beach activities: General Recreation (REC), Fishing (FISH), Water-based Recreation (WATER) and Off-road Driving (ORD). Overall, drivers emphasized motivations related to experiencing quiet and remote coastal landscapes, with less emphasis on experiencing wildlife or the capacity to carry equipment or pets. Levels of 'escapism and exploration' were higher for ORD, moderate and similar for REC and FISH, and lowest for WATER. Levels of 'experience and opportunity' differed between all user groups, being highest for ORD, FISH, REC then WATER. ORD were more likely to make one-way beach trips. There was no difference in track length (km) amongst user groups (means, 3.45-5.21 km). However, the speed of ORD (including stops) was almost double that of other recreational groups (highest speed recorded, 140 kph), and these drivers are estimated to cause wildlife disturbance on 70% of the area of the beaches on which they drove. Those visiting the beach with the express purpose of driving are therefore predicted to cause the most widespread ecological disturbance. The motivations that primarily relate to psychological well-being (i.e. escape) and adventure (i.e. exploration) compared with much less importance being placed on habitats and wildlife poses significant challenges to conservation of beach ecosystems subjected to vehicle traffic. Further research could identify sections of beaches less attractive to drivers and yet important for wildlife, thereby creating conservation areas that could be protected at lower socioeconomic costs whilst providing some refuge for beach-dwelling wildlife.","Petch, N.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Shortnose sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum) populations were decimated by a variety of anthropogenic activities throughout much of the 20th century. Understanding the spatial and temporal dynamics of spawning migrations within natal rivers is a critical information gap with regard to habitat protection and ultimately, species recovery. The objectives of this study were to document and describe seasonal movements of shortnose sturgeon in the Altamaha River system, Georgia. Passive acoustic telemetry was used to monitor the movements of 40 adult individuals from April 2011 through February 2014. Telemetry data revealed that during much of the year, the adults resided within the tidally influenced portion of the river, with most detections occurring near the freshwater-saltwater interface. Upstream movements to potential spawning habitat occurred during winter and early spring, and most fish returned to the lower estuary by April. Upstream migrations appeared to be triggered by environmental cues and were initiated when mean weekly temperatures in the lower Altamaha River were 11.6-16.9 degrees C. Unlike spawning migrations documented in northern rivers, the pattern of movement observed in this study was a single-step migration without an apparent resting or staging period. Upstream migrations during nonspawning months were also observed and appeared to correspond with increasing discharge, which potentially resulted in increased channel navigability and habitat availability in nondrought years. This study further illustrates the clinal variations in life history typical of the species and may have important implications on river-specific strategies for species recovery.","Ingram, E. C.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Variation in the home-range size of nesting animals is thought to be driven by nutritional requirements, food availability, and predation risk of the animals during foraging. Only few studies have considered that the risk of nest predation may also affect home-range size because nests become more difficult to defend as animals move further away. We used a theoretical model to explore the combined effects of nest defensibility, nest predation risk, and food availability on foraging distance from the nest, and hence home-range size. In our model, foragers adjust the foraging distance around the central place such that the required amount of food is collected within the available time with the lowest predation risk for the nest. We found that foraging distance decreased with food availability and the risk of nest predation during absence, but also with nest defensibility. When food was abundant, both nest predation risk and defensibility hardly influenced foraging distance. When food was scarce, animals able to deter predators foraged close-by, whereas animals less able to deter predators foraged further away. Likewise, animals that were themselves vulnerable to predation stayed closer to their nest if the nest provided safety, as is typical for central place foragers. This study is the first to assess the importance of nest defense and nest predation risk for foraging distance of central place foragers and provides a better understanding of the drivers of home-range size.","Lameris, Thomas K.

"savedrecs (30).txt","The interaction between granivorous scatterhoarding mammals and plants is a conditional mutualism: scatterhoarders consume seeds (acting as predators), but the movement of seed by scatterhoarders may contribute to dispersal (acting as mutualists). Understanding the ecological factors that shape this relationship is highly relevant in anthropogenically disturbed tropical forests where large-bodied frugivores are extirpated. In such forests, large-seeded trees that once depended on these frugivores for dispersal may now only have scatterhoarders as prospective dispersers. We studied Carapa oreophila (Meliaceae) in an Afromontane forest, to test the hypotheses that the proportion of seeds immediately consumed or hoarded (dispersed) would vary over a disturbance gradient. Temporal replication also afforded exploration of how habitat effects might vary with food availability. Using a Bayesian framework, we demonstrate that seeds were more likely to be hoarded in less disturbed forest, irrespective of temporal variation in food abundance. In contrast, forest disturbance only appeared to increase seed predation in temporal replicates that coincided with sustained food availability. These results highlight the potential variability in the dynamics between plants and scatterhoarders over fine temporal scales, elucidating possible ecological scenarios where scatterhoarders might act as mutualists (contributing positively to plant recruitment). Our study also fills important knowledge gaps about the importance of scatterhoarders as dispersers in tropical forests depleted of large-bodied frugivores, particularly in Africa where scatterhoarding mutualisms have not been extensively studied.","Aliyu, Babale

"savedrecs (30).txt","Little is known about he ecology and behavior of Rock Rattlesnakes (Crotalus lepidus) despite the species' wide geographic distribution throughout the southwestern United States and central Mexico. The goal of this study was to quantify space use, movement patterns, and habitat use by C. lepidus in the Chihuahuan Desert of extreme west Texas. We used radiotelernetry to monitor subjects during at least one activity season front 2007 to 2010. Mean (+/- 1 SE) home range size for all individuals was 13.69 +/- 3.06 ha, and mean daily movement rate was 8.46 +/- 1.45 m/d. Although monthly movement rates were similar, movement was greatest in September, corresponding with the peak of the mating season for C. lepidus at our study site. We used multational logit models to analyze habitat use patterns among telemetered snakes while controlling for subject, estimated habitat availability, and season. Our subjects were most often observed using small arroyos, despite these habitats being relatively limited spatially within snake home ranges. Conversely, habitats typically associated with C. lepidus life-history(e.g., alluvial rocky slopes) were more available to our subjects, but were used less frequently overall. We also detected seasonal associations in habitat use, with subjects being more likely to use alluvial rocky slopes during spring and shifting to arroyo habitat throughout summer. Snakes also used microhahitats nonrandomly, most often seeking refuge under shrubs where ground cover consisted primarily of vegetation rather than rock or gravel. Our study presents a detailed analysis of habitat and microhabitat use by this species, and the patterns of movement and borne range size reported here largely contrast to those found in the available literature on the spatial ecology of C. lepidus.","Mata-Silva, Vicente

"savedrecs (30).txt","1. Acoustic sampling methods are becoming increasingly important in biological monitoring. Sound attenuation is one of the most important dynamics affecting the utility of acoustic data as it directly affects the probability of detection of individuals by acoustic sensor arrays and especially the localization of acoustic signals necessary in telemetry studies. Therefore, models of sound attenuation are necessary to make efficient use of acoustic data in ecological monitoring and assessment applications. Models of attenuation in widespread use are based on Euclidean distance between source and sensor, which is justified under spherical attenuation of sound waves in homogeneous environments.
2. In this paper, I develop a model of sound attenuation based on a non-Euclidean cost-weighted distance metric which contains attenuation coefficients that characterize the attenuation of sound due to environmental heterogeneity in the vicinity of an acoustic sensor array.
3. I show that parameters of the proposed attenuation model can be estimated by maximum likelihood using experimental data from an array of fixed sources, thus allowing investigators who use bioacoustic methods to devise explicit models of sound attenuation in situ and apply them to localization of sources and density estimation. In addition, drawing on analogy with spatial capture-recapture models, I argue that parameters of the non-Euclidean model of attenuation can be estimated when source locations are unknown. Thus, the models can be applied to real field studies which require estimation of attenuation parameters or localization of signals.
4. Models of heterogeneous sound attenuation allow more accurate descriptions of acoustic monitoring data, and therefore should produce more accurate estimates of ecological parameters of interest, including source locations, density, and movement trajectories. Moreover, the ability to test specific hypotheses about the effects of habitat and landscape structure on sound attenuation can improve the design of acoustic monitoring arrays and lead to more efficient deployment of acoustic sensing technology.","Royle, J.

"savedrecs (30).txt","The environment plays a significant role in shaping the visibility of signals both to and from an organism. For example, against a static background movement is highly conspicuous, which favours staying still to optimize camouflage. However, backgrounds can also be highly dynamic, such as areas with wind-blown foliage or frequent changes in illumination. We propose that these dynamic features act as visual noise which could serve to mask otherwise conspicuous movement. Two forms of illumination change were simulated, water caustics and dappled light, to represent dynamic aquatic and terrestrial environments, respectively. When asked to capture moving prey items within the simulated scenes, human participants were significantly slower and more error prone when viewing scenes with dynamic illumination. This effect was near identical for both the aquatic and terrestrial environments. In the latter, prey item movement was also found to be masked most often when the pathway taken involved movement across the dynamic dappled areas of the scene. This could allow particularly moving prey to reduce their signalto-noise ratio by behaviourally favouring the relative safety of environments containing dynamic features. (C) 2018 The Authors.

"savedrecs (30).txt","The motion capture of alpine skiing is technically challenging. Motion capture systems using inertial sensors such as gyroscopes and accelerometers have begun to be used in sport. The capture volume of the system can be large enough to cover the whole area of a particular sporting event, because sensors are affixed to the human body itself. The current study developed a method of tracking the pose of an alpine skier using gyroscopes for 3 min with a tracking error of 2 degrees (RMSE). The technical significance of the presented method, which uses one common simple algorithm to improve measurement of pose, applies to many experimental conditions. The adoption of a high resolution (24 bit) analog-to-digital converter and high sampling rate (1 kHz) also contribute to the improvement of measurement time.","Yoshioka, Shinsuke

"savedrecs (30).txt","Determining an athlete's speed from broadcast video is a common practice in sport. Many software packages that perform data extraction from video files are expensive; however, open source software is also available, but lacks published validation for speed measurements. The purpose of this research was to examine the error of speed measurements extracted from video during an ice hockey skating exercise using open source software. The subject completed four exercises, at two speeds recorded by broadcast cameras set at five angles. The speeds from the broadcast cameras were compared to speeds calculated from a high-speed camera placed orthogonally to the exercise. Speeds from the broadcast cameras correlated well with the high-speed video for motion more than 12 m away from the broadcast camera. When comparing all the measured speeds, no significant difference was found between the speeds calculated by the high-speed camera (slow: 4.46 m/s +/- 0.2; fast: 7.2 m/s +/- 0.7) and the speed calculated from the broadcast cameras (slow: 4.50 m/s +/- 0.4; fast: 7.34 m/s +/- 0.6) (p > 0.05). The open source method was found to be less accurate when the athlete was close to (within 12 m of camera position) or moving directly toward the broadcast cameras.","Post, Andrew

"savedrecs (30).txt","Little is known about the movements and behavior of neonate eastern box turtles (Terrapene carolina carolina). We investigated spatial ecology of neonate eastern box turtles at 4 upland openings in the Manistee National Forest, Michigan, USA, 2012-2016. We protected nests and used radio-telemetry to document dispersal from nests, land cover types used for overwintering, and residency time of neonates in natal openings. We used binomial logistic regression to model probabilities of overwintering in natal openings versus adjacent forest and edge. We protected 64 nests, radio-fitted 64 neonates over 4 cohort years, tracked 46 neonates from nest emergence to their overwintering sites, and tracked 28 neonates for portions of their second activity season. Dispersal (straight-line distance from nest to overwintering site) was limited in the first activity season (n=46 neonates, (x) over bar =19.92.4m [SE], range=1.9-83.2m) and 24 overwintered in natal openings, 4 overwintered in the forest edge, and 18 overwintered in forest. Our best logistic model included the predictor variables distance from nest to nearest forest edge and day of nest emergence. Probability of overwintering within a natal opening was greater for neonates from nests located farther from the forest edge and for neonates emerging from nests later in the year. By 1 June of their second activity season, all tracked turtles were still present in, or within 50m, of their natal opening, but all neonates had dispersed into surrounding forest or wetlands by 1 July. Managers should be aware that neonates reside in or very near their natal openings for several months after nest emergence. When burning or otherwise intensively managing open canopy box turtle nesting areas, relaxing the interval (yr) between treatments and excluding forest edge and adjacent forest should allow neonates time to disperse, decreasing risk of mortality.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Gosling losses account for the majority of summer mortality for Canada geese (Branta canadensis), but survival at this stage can be difficult to estimate because of their small size, precocial behavior, and the land cover in which they live. Previous methods of measuring gosling survival often used individual markers, which can bias estimates when not accounting for total brood loss or emigration. We estimated gosling survival of Canada geese in the Atlantic Flyway Resident Population (AFRP) in New Jersey, USA, during 2009-2010 through use of marked parents and young to incorporate total and partial brood losses. The proportion of marked parents who lost their entire brood occurring during the first 3 weeks after hatch and prior to banding was 0.316. Gosling survival that accounted for partial brood loss was 0.4610.027 (SE), and was most influenced by nest density and the percent agriculture land use within 215m of the nest site. The gosling survival estimate incorporating total and partial brood losses during this study was 0.315 +/- 0.018. Acquiring current reproductive vital rates will assist in understanding the dynamics of recruitment as a function of population size. The above information, in combination with nest survival and annual survival estimates from band recovery and recapture analyses, has been used to inform a population model for Canada geese in the AFRP. (c) 2018 The Wildlife Society.
Our overall estimate of Canada goose gosling survival in New Jersey was reduced by 0.146 or 32% when we accounted for total brood loss, and most mortality occurred during the first 7 days after hatch. Use of multiple marking techniques to identify both individual goslings and broods through marked adults allows for corroboration of survival estimates.","Watts, Katherine G.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Satellite telemetry is a powerful tool used to follow animals through their annual life cycle, informing the understanding of behavior and distribution of many species. Because boreal- and arctic-nesting North American sea duck populations are challenging to survey, satellite telemetry is important for describing breeding distributions and identifying breeding population structure. Accurate knowledge of breeding distributions is needed for effective habitat and harvest management, but satellite telemetry is expensive so it is important to consider the effort necessary to accurately map breeding distributions. We construct 3 theoretical breeding distributions using existing telemetry data from 3 species of sea ducks, Barrow's goldeneye (Bucephala islandica), surf scoter (Melanitta perspicillata), and black scoter (M. americana), by fitting kernel densities to approximate breeding locations of individual birds. Then we determined the minimum sample size needed to approximate these theoretical breeding distributions by assessing the overlap between breeding densities simulated by sampling from the distributions and the theoretical breeding densities. Diminishing information gains with additional effort (i.e., <1-5% improvement in prediction) were reached with sample sizes ranging from 80 to 130. Sea duck mortality, transmitter failure, and exclusion of non-breeding individuals resulted in an effective sample size smaller than the number of birds originally marked. For the cases we considered, obtaining breeding locations for 80-130 individuals would require marking 11-41% more birds than the sample size goal. Thus, although satellite telemetry provides valuable information on sea duck populations, our analysis suggests that accurately estimating the extent and relative use of breeding habitats requires substantial investment.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Classical models for biological invasions were single-species models in homogeneous landscapes, but most invasions happen in the presence of interacting species and in heterogeneous environments. The combination of spatial variation and species interaction could alter the spreading process significantly. For example, the 'environmental heterogeneity hypothesis of invasions' posits that heterogeneity offers more opportunities for invaders and reduces the negative impact on native species. Environmental heterogeneity offers an obvious coexistence mechanism on the regional scale if two or more competing species have different spatial niches, i.e. if the local competitive advantage changes in space. We consider a more subtle mechanism of space use through individual movement behaviour when the local competitive advantage remains with the same species. Specifically, we model the densities of two species, diffusing and competing in an infinite landscape consisting of two types of patches. We include individual behaviour in terms of movement rate and patch preference. We consider the scenario that one of the species is the stronger local competitor in both patch types. We then uncover a number of mechanisms-based solely on movement behaviour-through which these two species can coexist regionally, how the inferior competitor can replace the superior competitor globally, or how a bistable situation can arise between the two. We calculate mutual invasion conditions as well as mutual spatial spread rates, and we show that spread rates may depend on movement parameters in unexpected ways.","Maciel, Gabriel Andreguetto

"savedrecs (30).txt","Movement is one of the key mechanisms for animals to deal with changes within their habitats. Therefore, resource variability can impact animals' home range formation, especially in spatially and temporally highly dynamic landscapes, such as farmland. However, the movement response to resource variability might depend on the underlying landscape structure.
We investigated whether a given landscape structure affects the level of home range size adaptation in response to resource variability. We tested whether increasing resource variability forces herbivorous mammals to increase their home ranges.
In 2014 and 2015 we collared 40 European brown hares (Lepus europaeus) with GPS-tags to record hare movements in two regions in Germany with differing landscape structures. We examined hare home range sizes in relation to resource availability and variability by using the normalized difference vegetation index as a proxy.
Hares in simple landscapes showed increasing home range sizes with increasing resource variability, whereas hares in complex landscapes did not enlarge their home range.
Animals in complex landscapes have the possibility to include various landscape elements within their home ranges and are more resilient against resource variability. But animals in simple landscapes with few elements experience shortcomings when resource variability becomes high. The increase in home range size, the movement related increase in energy expenditure, and a decrease in hare abundances can have severe implications for conservation of mammals in anthropogenic landscapes. Hence, conservation management could benefit from a better knowledge about fine-scaled effects of resource variability on movement behaviour.","Ullmann, W.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Functional connectivity, quantified using landscape genetics, can inform conservation through the identification of factors linking genetic structure to landscape mechanisms. We used breeding habitat metrics, landscape attributes, and indices of grouse abundance, to compare fit between structural connectivity and genetic differentiation within five long-established Sage-Grouse Management Zones (MZ) I-V using microsatellite genotypes from 6,844 greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) collected across their 10.7million-km(2) range. We estimated structural connectivity using a circuit theory-based approach where we built resistance surfaces using thresholds dividing the landscape into habitat and nonhabitat and nodes were clusters of sage-grouse leks (where feather samples were collected using noninvasive techniques). As hypothesized, MZ-specific habitat metrics were the best predictors of differentiation. To our surprise, inclusion of grouse abundance-corrected indices did not greatly improve model fit in most MZs. Functional connectivity of breeding habitat was reduced when probability of lek occurrence dropped below 0.25 (MZs I, IV) and 0.5 (II), thresholds lower than those previously identified as required for the formation of breeding leks, which suggests that individuals are willing to travel through undesirable habitat. The individual MZ landscape results suggested terrain roughness and steepness shaped functional connectivity across all MZs. Across respective MZs, sagebrush availability (<10%-30%; II, IV, V), tree canopy cover (>10%; I, II, IV), and cultivation (>25%; I, II, IV, V) each reduced movement beyond their respective thresholds. Model validations confirmed variation in predictive ability across MZs with top resistance surfaces better predicting gene flow than geographic distance alone, especially in cases of low and high differentiation among lek groups. The resultant resistance maps we produced spatially depict the strength and redundancy of range-wide gene flow and can help direct conservation actions to maintain and restore functional connectivity for sage-grouse.","Row, Jeffrey R.

"savedrecs (30).txt","When they visit and revisit specific areas, animals may reveal what they need from their home range and how they acquire information. The temporal dimension of such movement recursions, that is, periodicity, is however rarely studied, yet potentially bears a species, population or individual-specific signature. A recent method allows estimating the contribution of periodic patterns to the variance in a movement path. We applied it to 709 individuals from five ungulate species, looking for species signatures in the form of seasonal variation in the intensity of circadian patterns. Circadian patterns were commonplace in the movement tracks, but the amount of variance they explained was highly variable among individuals. It increased in intensity during spring and summer, when key resources were spatially segregated, and decreased during winter, when food availability was more uniformly low. Other periodicity-inducing mechanisms supported by our comparison of species- and sex-specific patterns involve young antipredator behaviour, territoriality and behavioural thermoregulation. Model-based continuous-time movement metrics represent a new avenue for researchers interested in finding individual-, population- or species-specific signatures in heterogeneous movement databases featuring various study designs and sampling resolutions. However, we observed large amounts of individual variation, so comparative analyses should ideally use both GPS and animal-borne loggers to augment the discriminatory power and be based on large samples. We briefly outline potential uses of the intensity of circadian patterns as a metric for the study of animal personality and community ecology.","Peron, Guillaume

"savedrecs (30).txt","Animal species likely have different strengths of host habitat preference (HHP) that might be characterized by a standardized index ranging from 0 (no preference) to 1 (maximum preference). We hypothesized that in some species, HHP may result from individuals dispersing out of the host habitat having a probability of turning back at the boundary, or after entering host habitat by reducing speed or increasing size of turning angles. Computer simulations of individuals moving between various sized patches of host and nonhost habitat were conducted based on these three behaviours hypothesized to affect HHP. In the rebounding model, simulations resulted in equilibria of animal numbers inside and outside of host habitat that depend on sizes of these areas, initial number and the rebounding probability. Curvilinear regression of simulation results suggested an equation that predicted numbers in the host habitat and was solved for rebounding probability. A modified equation that sampled population densities (e.g., insect pheromone trap catches) inside and outside host habitat areas gave the rebounding probability, an index of HHP, without requiring the sizes of the areas. Simulations with traps and moving animals verified that the modified equation could predict the index correctly. The modified equation also estimates an index of HHP from sampled densities due to speed reductions and a combination of this and rebounding. Changes in angular turning size upon entering host habitat, however, did not affect habitat preference. Using pheromone trap captures, we found that the lesser date moth Batrachedra amydraula has a HHP for date Phoenix dactylifera plantations of 0.96. Host habitat preference indexes also were calculated from sampled insect densities reported in the literature. The new index of HHP is useful to characterize habitat patches of many organisms and aid understanding of animal spatial distributions and speciation processes. In addition, the index can be applied in studies of invasive species, trap crops of pest insects and conservation management.","Byers, John A.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Giraffes reside in a fission-fusion social system, with sex, age proximity, kinship and home range overlap accounting for some of the variance in herd composition, while season, sex, age and time of day influence diet, home range size and distance travelled. To increase our knowledge of habitat use and fission-fusion herd dynamics, we placed GPS devices on eight adult female South African giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis giraffa) living in the Khamab Kalahari Nature Reserve (South Africa). We tested four predictions about how season, kinship, home range and travel patterns influence habitat use and herd dynamics. Our two key findings were that females with a greater degree of home range overlap were more likely to form herds, but the degree of overlap was independent of the amount of time that they spent together in a herd, and that on the day prior to herd formation, females travelled about twice as far as their daily average and tended to move directly towards their future herd mate. We conclude that habitat use and movement patterns regulating fission-fusion dynamics reflect an interaction of ecological, social and reproductive factors operating in tandem, not independently.
Resume Les girafes connaissent un systeme social en fission-fusion, et le sexe, la proximite des ages, la parente et le chevauchement de leur domaine vital comptent pour une partie de la variance dans la composition du troupeau tandis que les saisons, le sexe, l'age et l'heure du jour influencent le regime alimentaire, la taille du domaine vital et les distances parcourues. Pour mieux connaitre l'utilisation de l'habitat et la dynamique fission-fusion du troupeau, nous avons place des appareils GPS sur huit girafes femelles adultes (Giraffa camelopardalis giraffa) de la Khamab Kalahari Nature Reserve en Afrique du Sud. Nous avons teste quatre modeles de prevision quant a la facon dont la saison, le degre de parente, le domaine vital, et le schema des deplacements influencent l'utilisation de l'habitat et la dynamique du troupeau. Nos deux decouvertes principales furent que les femelles qui avaient un plus fort taux de chevauchement de leur domaine vital etaient plus susceptibles de former un troupeau, mais que le taux de chevauchement etait independant de la quantite de temps qu'elles passaient ensemble au sein d'un troupeau et que, le jour precedant la formation du troupeau, les femelles pouvaient parcourir jusqu'a deux fois leur distance journaliere moyenne et avaient tendance a se diriger directement vers leur futur partenaire du troupeau. Nous en concluons que l'utilisation de l'habitat et le schema des deplacements regulant la dynamique fission-fusion refletent une interaction de facteurs ecologiques, sociaux et reproducteurs operant en tandem et non independamment.","Deacon, Francois

"savedrecs (30).txt","Water motion, because of its potential to dislodge intertidal organisms, plays a crucial role in shaping marine communities as it creates available spaces suitable for interactions, settlement and colonization. To understand how water flow influences the behavioural ecology of benthic species such as echinoids, we investigated how the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus (Lamark, 1816) can cope with increasing flow velocities through a biomechanical and behavioural approach. Whereas sea urchins maintained in static conditions for several weeks showed weak adhesive properties, they immediately reacted to increasing hydrodynamic forces. Sea urchins were dislodged at a flow velocity of about 70 cm s(-1), with a few individuals enduring up to 90 cm s(-1). This response was modulated by two behavioural strategies: (1) at low flow velocities, an escaping strategy characterized by fast upstream locomotion relying on tube feet; and (2) above a threshold flow, a streamlining strategy characterized by changes in overall shape and spines orientation, accompanied by a fast decrease of the animal's movement until complete immobility. Although the threshold at which the switch in behaviour occurs and the detachment velocities were both probably underestimated because individuals were aquarium-acclimatized, the behavioural sequence reported reveals how P. lividus can avoid or withstand rough weather conditions. From an ecological perspective, the occurrence of a range of water velocities too slow to dislodge sea urchins but sufficient to inhibit their active movement is relevant to understand how echinoids can structure benthic communities by controlling macroalgae development through their grazing activity.","Cohen-Rengifo, Mishal

"savedrecs (30).txt","The persistence of large carnivores in human-dominated landscapes is conditional on the preservation of adequate ecological conditions during the reproduction period, when they may be particularly susceptible to human disturbance. However, little is known about the breeding behaviour of large carnivores in these landscapes, though this is important for conservation management. Here we describe the space use and homesite attendance patterns of wolves inhabiting humanised landscapes of north-western Portugal, based on GPS tracking of 11 individuals in 2008-2013. Parturitions (N = 3) occurred in late May, with pups remaining at natal dens for 24-85 days, after which they were moved to a first and then sometimes to a second rendezvous site. Two of these movements were associated with human disturbance events. Breeding females (N = 4) spent a large proportion of time with pups during pre-weaning (approximate to 2 months after birth), leaving only at night during short periods; thereafter they progressively reduced time at homesites (i.e, natal dens and rendezvous sites), and increased both daily travel distances and daytime activity. Throughout the pup-rearing season, breeding females restricted their movements to within approximate to 2 km of homesites. Non-breeding females (N = 4) showed significantly lower attendance rates than breeding females, particularly during pre-weaning, and they had much less restricted movements throughout the breeding season, with activity occurring throughout the circadian cycle. Non-breeding males (N = 3) showed attendance and space-use patterns intermediate between breeding and non-breeding females, with movements largely concentrated within the same areas used by breeding females. Our findings suggest that breeding wolves may be particularly susceptible to human activities occurring within 2 km of homesites, although further research is needed to assess the ultimate effect of such disturbance on reproductive success and pup survival.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Symbionts are a fundamental component of biological systems, and their survival is highly dependent on transmission and host movement. Ectosymbionts of amphibious animals face the added challenge of having to survive dramatic environmental changes as their hosts cross ecosystem boundaries. Within freshwaters, crayfish are amongst the most widespread invasive species that readily disperse overland and are host to a wide range of ectosymbionts. Relatively little is known about the transmission of these ectosymbionts, including their ability to survive overland host migration. Here, we assessed terrestrial emigration and both inter- and intra-specific transmissions of Xironogiton victoriensis, a non-native branchiobdellidan (Annelida: Clitellata) recently found on invasive signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) in the UK. These branchiobdellidans tolerated desiccation and did not alter host terrestrial behaviour. Transmission was rapid between natural signal and novel virile (Orconectes cf. virilis) crayfish hosts, with host interactions facilitating transmission. Thus, branchiobdellidans can disperse via amphibious host behaviour and readily infect novel hosts. These traits facilitate symbionts' survival and provide access to additional dispersal pathways that are likely to aid transmission.","Hunt, Rhiannon

"savedrecs (30).txt","There is a growing body of catch-and-release (C&R) science showing that adjusting the way fish are caught, handled, and released can reduce impacts on individuals and populations. However, a major caveat is that C&R will be a more effective conservation tool if best practice guidelines stemming from the science are understood, embraced, and adopted by recreational anglers. In recognition of this, Keepemwet Fishing (KWF) has emerged as a nonpartisan movement to provide simple, clear, and accurate C&R guidelines that transcend species and subcultures within the recreational angling community. The foundations of the KWF movement are science-based best practices, clear translations of the science, and a diverse and growing set of stakeholder groups that are sharing the Keepemwet sentiment via social media and other communication channels. We highlight the power of this grassroots movement, as well as potential hurdles that KWF and other social brands will need to overcome to broaden their effectiveness in making C&R guidelines more accessible and appealing to the public. Given the apparent increase in bottom-up attempts to disseminate best practices to anglers, the lessons learned from the KWF movement have the potential to be of great benefit to other groups engaged in angler outreach related to best practices and broader recreational fisheries conservation.","Danylchuk, Andy J.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Understanding the nature of migratory behaviors within animal populations is critical to develop and refine conservation and management plans. However, tracking migratory marine animals across life stages and over multiple years is inherently difficult to achieve, especially for highly migratory species. In this paper, we explore the use of acoustic telemetry to characterize the spatial ecology of Atlantic tarpon (Megalops atlanticus), elucidate the ecology of this poorly studied species, and ultimately inform conservation and management. Using the data from twenty-two acoustically tagged Atlantic tarpon, we found a diversity of tarpon migratory patterns, including spatial and temporal overlap for some individuals. We also reveal fine scale movements within specific ecosystems, as well as a range of distributions and connectivity across coastal waters of the southeastern United States of America. For tarpon with tracking durations greater than one month (n = 13), we found heterogeneous space use and migratory connectivity with some tarpon remaining close to their capture location while others migrated hundreds of kilometers. In addition, we were able to identify a northern and southern limit for one migratory tarpon that had detections spanning over 365 days. We share analyses on Atlantic tarpon data, including model-driven approaches and network analysis, to investigate movement strategies and space use, which may be pertinent to other studies involving highly migratory species. The project was a collaborative effort involving several acoustic telemetry networks which enabled the monitoring of broad- and fine-scale movements for extended periods of time that would normally be difficult to achieve with other monitoring techniques. Although challenges exist with applying acoustic telemetry to monitor highly migratory species, we also discuss its value in enabling researchers to assess movements and space use beyond the focal species, such as cross-ecosystem comparisons and multi-species interactions.","Griffin, Lucas P.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Brown bears (Ursus arctos) spend about half of the year in winter dens. In order to preserve energy, bears may select denning locations that minimize temperature loss and human disturbance. In expanding animal populations, demographic structure and individual behavior at the expansion front can differ from core areas. We conducted a non-invasive study of male brown bear den sites at the male-biased, low-density western expansion front of the Scandinavian brown bear population, comparing den locations to the available habitat. Compared to the higher-density population core in which intraspecific avoidance may affect den site selection of subordinate bears, we expected resource competition in the periphery to be low, and all bears to be able to select optimal den sites. In addition, bears in the periphery had access to free-ranging domestic sheep during summer. We found that males in the periphery denned on high-elevation slopes, probably providing good drainage, longer periods of consistent, insulating snow cover and fewer melting-freezing events. Forests were the principal denning habitat and no dens were found in alpine areas. The Scandinavian brown bears have a history of intense harvest, including culling at the den. This may have exerted a selection pressure to avoid denning in open alpine habitat which compared to forests provide little cover. The bears denned away from main roads and in steep, rugged terrain, probably limiting human access. The odds for finding a bear den decreased with increasing distance to the population core where females could be found. Previous studies have documented directed movement of male brown bears from the male-biased population periphery toward the core areas during the mating season. In this way, denning males may be trading off between low resource competition and access to sheep in the low-density periphery, and mating opportunities in the higher-density population core.","Eriksen, Ane

"savedrecs (30).txt","Five evacuation experiments were performed in a road tunnel in order to test how pedestrians react when exposed to reduced visibility, how the decision making process is carried out, and finally what is the impact of various circumstances like: different level of smokiness, competitive behavior or learning effect on an evacuation process. In four experiments pedestrians were exposed to artificial, non-toxic smoke. During evacuation of a group of people gathered in low and moderate level of smokiness (when Cs < 0.5m(-1)) we observed multi-line patterns created by pedestrians. Decision making was engaged in only by the first group of passengers, while under heavy smokiness Cs > 0.7m(-1) we have observed decision making by small groups and characteristic double-lines patterns. In four experiments the same group of participants was involved, and a learning effect was observed: increasingly shorter pre-movement time and decreasing time required to leave the main tunnel. We show, that movement speed in smoke is influenced by the evacuees' attitude and familiarity with environment and evacuation procedures and not only by the visibility level.","Porzycki, Jakub

"savedrecs (30).txt","How animal movement decisions interact with the distribution of resources to shape individual performance is a key question in ecology. However, links between spatial and behavioural ecology and fitness consequences are poorly understood because the outcomes of individual resource selection decisions, such as energy intake, are rarely measured. In the open ocean, mesoscale features (approx. 10-100 km) such as fronts and eddies can aggregate prey and thereby drive the distribution of foraging vertebrates through bottom-up biophysical coupling. These productive features are known to attract predators, yet their role in facilitating energy transfer to top-level consumers is opaque. We investigated the use of mesoscale features by migrating northern elephant seals and quantified the corresponding energetic gains from the seals' foraging patterns at a daily resolution. Migrating elephant seals modified their diving behaviour and selected for mesoscale features when foraging. Daily energy gain increased significantly with increasing mesoscale activity, indicating that the physical environment can influence predator fitness at fine temporal scales. Results show that areas of high mesoscale activity not only attract top predators as foraging hotspots, but also lead to increased energy transfer across trophic levels. Our study provides evidence that the physical environment is an important factor in controlling energy flow to top predators by setting the stage for variation in resource availability. Such understanding is critical for assessing how changes in the environment and resource distribution will affect individual fitness and food web dynamics.","Abrahms, Briana

"savedrecs (30).txt","Background: Millions of flying migrants encounter the Great Lakes and other large water bodies on long-distance flights each spring and fall, but quantitative data regarding how they traverse these obstacles are limited. Shorelines are known areas of migrant concentration due to the ecological barrier effect, but details on the magnitude of this concentration and the flight behaviors causing it are largely unknown and difficult to quantify. Mobile avian radar can provide a unique view of how birds and bats move across landscapes by tracking thousands of individual migrants moving through a sample volume that extends multiple kilometers in radius.
Results: During the spring of 2014 we used two avian radar units to compare migration patterns at shoreline (1.5 km from the shore) and inland (20 km from the shore) sites along the eastern shoreline of Lake Michigan in the north-central US. We found shoreline activity to be 27% greater than inland activity over all time periods, and 132% greater during the hour surrounding dawn. An analysis of flight directions found that migrants flew to the north and northwest during dusk and night, with many heading out over the lake, but shifted direction towards the east at dawn, as those flying over water reoriented towards land. This shift in direction, which was most intense at the shoreline, may contribute to the higher concentrations of migrants observed at shorelines in this study and others.
Conclusions: These findings help confirm and quantify the phenomenon of nocturnal migrant reorientation at dawn, and also stress the functional importance of coastal regions for aerial migrants. The high use of coasts by migrants highlights the importance of conserving shoreline stopover habitat, which often competes with anthropogenic uses. We suggest using a high degree of caution when assessing potential impacts from development in these sensitive environments, and encourage protection of these high-use areas.","Heist, Kevin W.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Approaches to identify the perception of tinnitus in various animal models have been difficult to apply to mouse. As a result, mice have been underutilized to investigate the cellular, molecular, and genetic mechanisms underlying tinnitus. A recent study in guinea pigs identified a novel spontaneous behavior (unconditioned response), changes in movement during silent gaps, that identified a subgroup of animals presumably with tinnitus. Guinea pigs identified with tinnitus failed to ''freeze'' in response to silent gaps in sound. In the hope of developing a rapid and reliable assay for mice, we used a similar approach. C57BL/6J mice underwent three trials in which spontaneous movement was video recorded in the presence of white noise interrupted with six silent gaps. Movement metrics included velocity and body movement. Before the third trial, mice underwent either sham or noise exposure to induce hearing loss and tinnitus. Auditory brainstem responses before and after noise trauma confirmed normal hearing in sham-treated animals and hearing loss in the noise-exposed cohort. No differences in the various movement metrics were detected during the silent gaps either before or after sham/noise exposure. Variability in spontaneous movement both before and after sham/noise exposure was substantially greater in mice compared to guinea pigs. Thus, this assay is not sufficiently statistically powerful to identify changes in movement that might indicate tinnitus perception in mice. Previous observations also reported increased movement overall in guinea pigs identified as suffering tinnitus. In contrast, mice showed no statistically significant differences in movement between the three trials. Despite our results, other unconditioned (as well as conditioned) behaviors should be examined in mice to test their utility to detect changes that indicate the perception of tinnitus. Such assays are essential to accelerate the use of mouse models in tinnitus research.","Reijntjes, Daniel O. J.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Prey animals have evolved a wide variety of behaviours to combat the threat of predation, and these have been generally well studied. However, one of the most common and taxonomically widespread antipredator behaviours of all has, remarkably, received almost no experimental attention: so-called 'protean' behaviour. This is behaviour that is sufficiently unpredictable to prevent a predator anticipating in detail the future position or actions of its prey. In this study, we used human 'predators' participating in 3D virtual reality simulations to test how protean (i.e. unpredictable) variation in prey movement affects participants' ability to visually target them as they move (a key determinant of successful predation). We found that targeting accuracy was significantly predicted by prey movement path complexity, although, surprisingly, there was little evidence that high levels of unpredictability in the underlying movement rules equated directly to decreased predator performance. Instead, the specific movement rules differed in how they impacted on targeting accuracy, with the efficacy of protean variation in one element depending on the values of the remaining elements. These findings provide important insights into the understudied phenomenon of protean antipredator behaviour, which are directly applicable to predator-prey dynamics within a broad range of taxa.","Richardson, Graham

"savedrecs (30).txt","Migratory species link spatially separated ecosystems, and understanding their migrations is critical for conservation and management. The cownose ray Rhinoptera bonasus is a large-bodied batoid ray implicated in shellfish declines along the US Atlantic coast, but its migrations and habitat use remain poorly understood. We used passive acoustic telemetry to track tagged adult female (N = 27) and male (N = 9) rays released during summer and fall 2014-2016 in Maryland, Virginia, and Georgia. Twenty-three tags provided data for more than 1 yr. Individuals from all tagging locations overwintered in the same region offshore of Cape Canaveral, Florida, then returned in summer to the estuaries where tagging took place. Hidden Markov modeling identified 3 behavioral states (Resident, Ranging, Migratory), with ray movements generally classified as non-migratory (Resident and Ranging behavioral states) in summer and winter, and migratory (Migratory behavioral state) in spring and fall. Linear discriminant analysis suggested strong philopatry to tagging locations. This study provides the first full annual migration tracks for cownose rays along the US Atlantic coast, indicating that they migrate between summer pupping and mating habitats in estuaries south of Long Island, New York, and shared overwintering habitats off the east coast of Florida near Cape Canaveral. Our results highlight the value of national-scale networks of acoustic telemetry arrays for identifying migratory patterns of highly mobile marine species.","Ogburn, Matthew B.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Understanding the overlap of animal distributions and anthropogenic activity is essential for effective conservation management. Here, we analysed data from satellite transmitters deployed on 35 adult female flatback turtles nesting in the vicinity of an iron ore port to understand the spatial and temporal components of the main phases of their breeding cycle and assessed overlap with this industrial activity. During the inter-nesting phase, flatback turtles remained 14 +/- 9 km from their nesting site. On their transit to foraging grounds they did not use a discrete corridor, using an area from the coast out to the 50 m contour and dispersed widely to foraging grounds (18 to 1326 km away) that had low spatial overlap among individuals. The home range of 94 % of turtles during inter-nesting, 26% during outward transit and 3% during foraging had overlap with the shipping channel associated with the port. Although these results suggest that risks associated with vessel collision would be increased during the nesting season and early part of the transit to foraging grounds, no such impacts were detected. Outside of these times (>80% of the time), industrial activities in this area are likely to be low risk to flatback turtles from the main studied rookery. We also provide the first information on the diving behaviour and in situ water temperature data of flatback turtles during the post-nesting migration, showing that turtles forage both on the benthos and within the water column, and that some turtles forage in relatively deep and stratified water.","Thums, Michele

"savedrecs (30).txt","The present work is a reanalysis of prior work documenting postural sway in phasmids (i.e., ""stick insects"") [1]. The prior work pursued the possibility that postural sway was an evolutionary adaptation supporting motion camouflage to avoid the attention of predators. For instance, swaying along with leaves blown by the wind might reduce the likelihood of standing out to a predator. The present work addresses the alternative-but by no means conflicting and perhaps more explanatory-proposal that phasmid postural sway carries evidence of the tensegrity-like structures allowing postural stabilization under wind-like stimulation. Tensegrity structures are prestressed architectures embodying nonlinear interactions across scales of space and time that provide context-sensitive responses faster than neural tissue can support. Multifractal modeling of the postural-displacement series initially recorded in [1] offers a metric equally effective for quantifying complexity of phasmid postural sway under wind stimulation as for quantifying complexity of human postural sway [2-7]. Furthermore, multifractal modeling offers a means to demonstrate empirically the nonlinear interactions across space and time scales in body-wide coordination that tensegrity-based hypotheses predict. Specifically, multifractal modeling allows diagnosing the strength and direction of nonlinear interactions across time scale as the difference between multifractal estimates for the original postural-displacement series and for a sample of best-fitting linear models of the series. The reduction of postural sway directly following the application of wind stimulus appears as a significant decrease in the multifractal structure for original postural-displacement series as compared to best-fitting linear models of those series. This decrease indicates the capacity for nonlinear interactions across time scale to constrict variability, which is an aspect of nonlinear dynamics often overshadowed by the possibility that nonlinearity can produce more variability. This work offers the longer-range opportunity that multifractal modeling could provide a common language within which to coordinate behavioral sciences across a wide range of species.","Kelty-Stephen, Damian G.","Kelty-Stephen, DG",NA,NA,"[Kelty-Stephen, Damian G.] Grinnell Coll, Dept Psychol, Grinnell, IA 50112 USA.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.1371/journal.pone.0202367","Article",NA,NA,"Clarivate Analytics Web of Science",NA,NA,"GR6TZ",NA,"EXTATOSOMA-TIARATUM; HUMAN COGNITION; DYNAMICS; FLUCTUATIONS;

"savedrecs (30).txt","Many scholars suggest that visa restrictions push individuals who would have otherwise migrated legally toward illegal channels. This expectation is difficult to test empirically for three reasons. First, unauthorized migration is clandestine and often unobservable. Second, interpersonal ties between migrants and would-be migrants form a self-perpetuating system, which adapts in ways that are difficult to observe or predict. Third, empirical evaluations of immigration policy are vulnerable to endogeneity and other issues of causal inference. In this paper, we pair tailor-made empirical designs with an agent-based computational model (ABM) to capture the dynamics of a migration system that often elude empirical analysis, while grounding agent rules and characteristics with primary data collected in Jamaica, an origin country. We find that some government-imposed restrictions on migrants can deter total migration, but others are ineffective. Relative to a system of free movement, the minimal eligibility conditions required to classify migrants into visa categories alone make migration inaccessible for many. Restrictive policies imposed on student and high-skilled visa categories have little added effect because eligible individuals are likely able to migrate through alternative legal categories. Meanwhile, restrictions on family-based visas result in significant reductions in total migration. However, they also produce the largest reorientation toward unauthorized channels-an unintended consequence that even the highest rates of apprehension do not effectively eliminate.","Simon, Miranda

"savedrecs (30).txt","Background: Persistent declines in migratory songbird populations continue to motivate research exploring contributing factors to inform conservation efforts. Nearctic-Neotropical migratory species' population declines have been linked to habitat loss and reductions in habitat quality due to increasing urbanization in areas used throughout the annual cycle. Despite an increase in the number of studies on post-fledging ecology, generally characterized by the period between fledging and dispersal from natal areas or migration, contextual research linking post-fledging survival and habitat use to anthropogenic factors remains limited.
Methods: Here, we examined habitat use of post-fledging habitat-generalist gray catbirds (Dumetella caroliniensis), and habitat-specialist wood thrushes (Hylocichla mustelina), up to 88 days after fledging within an urbanized landscape. These Neotropical migratory species share many life-history traits, exhibit differential degrees of habitat specialization, and co-occur in urbanized landscapes. Starting from daily movement data, we used time-integrated Brownian bridges to generate probability density functions of each species' probability of occurrence, and home range among 16 land cover classes including roads from the US Geological Survey National Land Cover Database for each species.
Results: Habitat use differed between pre-and post-independence periods. After controlling for factors that influence habitat use (i.e., pre- or post-independence period, fate (whether individuals survived or not), and land cover class), we found that wood thrushes occupied home ranges containing six times more forest land cover than catbirds. In contrast, catbirds occupied home ranges containing twice the area of roads compared to wood thrushes. Wood thrushes had greater variance for area used (km(2)) among land cover classes within home ranges compared to catbirds. However, once fledglings achieved independence from parents, wood thrushes had lower variance associated with area used compared to catbirds.
Conclusions: Our findings support predictions that habitat-generalist gray catbirds spend more time in developed areas, less time in forest habitat, and use areas with more roads than the forest-specialist wood thrush. We found strong effects of pre-and post-independence periods on all of the response variables we tested. Species-specific habitat use patterns will likely be affected by projected increases in urbanization over the next several decades leading to further reductions in available forest habitat and increased road density, and will have important implications for the ecology and conservation of these birds.","Ladin, Zachary S.

"savedrecs (30).txt","We argue here that despite the focus in cities on location and place, it is increasingly clear that a requisite understanding of how cities evolve and change depends on a thorough understanding of human movements at aggregate scales where we can observe emergent patterns in networks and flow systems. We argue that the location of activities must be understood as summations or syntheses of movements or flows, with a much clearer link between flows, activities and the networks that carry and support them. To this end, we introduce a generic class of models that enable aggregated flows of many different kinds of social and economic activity, ranging from the journey to work to email traffic, to be predicted using ideas from discrete choice theory in economics which has analogies to gravitation. We also argue that visualization is an essential construct in making sense of flows but that there are important limitations to illustrating pictorially systems with millions of component parts. To demonstrate these, we introduce a class of generic spatial interaction models and present two illustrations. Our first application is based on transit flows within the high-frequency city over very short time periods of minutes and hours for data from the London Underground. Our second application scales up these models from districts and cities to the nation, and we demonstrate how flows of people from home to work and vice versa define cities and related settlements at much coarser scales. We contrast this approach with more disaggregate, individual studies of flow systems in cities that we consider an essential complement to the ideas presented here.

"savedrecs (30).txt","The similarities between the structures built by social insects and by humans have led to a convergence of interests between biologists and architects. This new, de facto interdisciplinary community of scholars needs a common terminology and theoretical framework in which to ground its work. In this conceptually oriented review paper, we review the terms 'information', 'space' and 'architecture' to provide definitions that span biology and architecture. A framework is proposed on which interdisciplinary exchange may be better served, with the view that this will aid better cross-fertilization between disciplines, working in the areas of collective behaviour and analysis of the structures and edifices constructed by non-humans; and to facilitate how this area of study may better contribute to the field of architecture. We then use these definitions to discuss the informational content of constructions built by organisms and the influence these have on behaviour, and vice versa. We review how spatial constraints inform and influence interaction between an organism and its environment, and examine the reciprocity of space and information on construction and the behaviour of humans and social insects.

"savedrecs (30).txt","The physical spaces within which organisms live affect their biology and in many cases can be considered part of their extended phenotype. The nests of social insect societies have a fundamental impact on their ability to function as complex superorganisms. Ants in many species excavate elaborate subterranean nests, but others inhabit relatively small pre-formed cavities within rock crevices and hollow seeds. Temnothorax ants, which often nest within acorns, have become a model system for studying collective decision making. While these ants have demonstrated remarkable degrees of rationality and consistent precision with regard to their nest choices, never before has the fine scale internal architecture and spatial organization of their nests been investigated. We used X-ray microtomography to record high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) scans of Temnothorax colonies within their acorns. These data were then quantified using image segmentation and surface-based 3D visibility graph analysis, a new computational methodology for analysing spatial structures. The visibility graph analysis method integrates knowledge from the field of architecture with the empirical study of animal-built structures, thus providing the first methodological cross-disciplinary synergy of these two research areas. We found a surprisingly high surface area and degree of spatial heterogeneity within the acorn nests. Specific regions, such as those associated with the locations of queens and brood, were significantly more conducive to connectivity than others. From an architect's point of view, spatial analysis research has never focused on all-surface 3D movement, as we describe within ant nests. Therefore, we believe our approach will provide new methods for understanding both human design and the comparative biology of habitat spaces.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) populations typically undertake seasonal migrations, spending winters in low latitude breeding grounds and summers foraging in high latitude feeding grounds. Until recently, a broad scale understanding of whale movement has been derived from whaling records, Discovery marks, photo identification and genetic analyses. However, with advances in satellite tagging technology and concurrent development of analytical methodologies we can now detail finer scale humpback whale movement, infer behavioural context and examine how these animals interact with their physical environment. Here we describe the temporal and spatial characteristics of migration along the east Australian seaboard and into the Southern Ocean by 30 humpback whales satellite tagged over three consecutive austral summers. We characterise the putative Antarctic feeding grounds and identify supplemental foraging within temperate, migratory corridors. We demonstrate that Antarctic foraging habitat is associated with the marginal ice zone, with key predictors of inferred foraging behaviour including distance from the ice edge, ice melt rate and variability in ice concentration two months prior to arrival. We discuss the highly variable ice season within the putative foraging habitat and the implications that this and other environmental factors may have on the continued strong recovery of this humpback whale population.","Andrews-Goff, V

"savedrecs (30).txt","We sought to objectively quantify and compare the recorded movement and location patterns of laying hens within a commercial system. Using a custom tracking system, we monitored the location within five zones of a commercial aviary for 13 hens within a flock of 225 animals for a contiguous period of 11 days. Most hens manifested a hen-specific pattern that was (visually) highly consistent across days, though, within that consistency, manifested stark differences between hens. Three different methods were used to classify individual daily datasets into groups based on their similarity: (i) Linear Discriminant Analysis based on six summary variables (transitions into each zone) and total transitions; (ii) Hierarchical Clustering, a naive clustering analysis technique, applied to summary variables and iii) Hierarchical Clustering applied to dissimilarity matrices produced by Dynamic Time Warping. The three methods correctly classified more than 85% of the hen days and provided a unique means to assess behaviour of a system indicating a considerable degree of complexity and structure. We believe the current effort is the first to document these location and movement patterns within a large, complex commercial system with a large potential to influence the assessment of animal welfare, health, and productivity.","Rufener, C.

"savedrecs (30).txt","An individual's body size is central to its behaviour and physiology, and tightly linked to its movement ability. The spatial arrangement of resources and a consumer's capacity to locate them are therefore expected to exert strong selection on consumer body size. We investigated the evolutionary impact of both the fragmentation and loss of habitat on consumer body size and its feedback effects on resource distribution, under varying levels of information used during habitat choice. We developed a mechanistic, individual-based, spatially explicit model, including several allometric rules for key consumer traits. Our model reveals that as resources become more fragmented and scarce, informed habitat choice selects for larger body sizes while random habitat choice promotes small sizes. Information use may thus be an overlooked explanation for the observed variation in body size responses to habitat fragmentation. Moreover, we find that resources can accumulate and aggregate if information about resource abundance is incomplete. Informed movement results in stable resource-consumer dynamics and controlled resources across space. However, habitat loss and fragmentation destabilize local dynamics and disturb resource suppression by the consumer. Considering information use during movement is thus critical to understand the eco-evolutionary dynamics underlying the functioning and structuring of consumer communities.","Hillaert, Jasmijn

"savedrecs (30).txt","Forest managers are often tasked with balancing opposing objectives, such as altering forest structure and conserving forest-dwelling animals. Consequently, to develop holistic strategies managers require information on how forest manipulations influence species of conservation concern, particularly those that are federally threatened or endangered. Here, we characterized how differing silvicultural treatments (n = 1,293 - forest thinnings; removal of small trees, selection cuts; trees harvested in small patches, and regeneration cuts; clearcuts of nearly all trees) influenced the resource use of a threatened forest carnivore, Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis), over a temporal gradient of 1-67 years after treatment. To do this, we used an extensive GPS dataset on 66 Canada lynx (i.e., 164,593 locations) collected during 2004-2015 within the Northern Rocky Mountains, U.S. We used univariate analyses and hurdle regression models to evaluate the spatio-temporal factors influencing lynx use of treatments. Our analyses indicated that Canada lynx used treatments, but there was a consistent cost in that lynx use was low up to similar to 10 years after all silvicultural actions. However, cumulative use (in both winter and summer) by lynx reached 50% at similar to 20 years after a thinning treatment, whereas it took similar to 34-40 years after a selection or regeneration cut. This indicated that Canada lynx used thinnings at a faster rate post-treatment than selection or regeneration cuts, and that lynx used selection and regeneration cuts in a similar fashion over time. Further, we discovered that lynx occupancy and intensity of treatment use was influenced by the composition of forest structure in the surrounding neighborhood. In some instances, the existing forest structure surrounding the treatment and the time since treatment interactively influenced lynx use; a pattern characterizing a spatio-temporal functional response in habitat use. This demonstrated that both the recovery time as well as the spatial context of a particular area are important considerations when implementing different silvicultural treatments for Canada lynx at the landscape scale. For example, if a selection cut was implemented with abundant mature, multi-storied forest (i.e., a preferred habitat by lynx) in the surrounding landscape, lynx would use these treatments less over time than if the neighborhood contained less mature forest. Forest managers can apply our spatio-temporal understandings of how lynx respond to forest silviculture to refine expectations and develop strategies aimed at both forest management and the conservation of Canada lynx.","Holbrook, Joseph D.

"savedrecs (30).txt","The invasive Asian shore crab, Hemigrapsus sanguineus, is ubiquitous in the rocky intertidal zone of the western North Atlantic. A likely contributor to this colonization is that H. sanguineus is able to handle a wide range of salinities, and is thus more likely to spread through a greater geographic area of estuaries. This study investigated the salinity effects on this animal by observing survival across a range of salinities, the maintenance of hemolymph osmolality under different salinities, and behaviorally preference for and avoidance of salinities. H. sanguineus showed high survival across a broad range of salinities, had little change in hemolymph osmolality over a short-term salinity shock, and behaviorally distinguished between salinities when presented with a choice, under both acclimation salinities of 5 PSU or 35 PSU. Such results suggest H. sanguineus has a hardiness for the rapid changes in salinity that happen in the intertidal zone, yet is capable of physically moving to a more optimal salinity. This enhances their competitiveness as an invader, particularly surviving lower salinities that present challenges during high-precipitation events in rocky intertidal areas, and partially explains this species' dominance in this habitat type.","Hudson, David M.

"savedrecs (30).txt","GPS-derived Total Electron Content (TEC) is an integrated quantity; hence it is difficult to relate the detection of ionospheric perturbations in TEC to a precise altitude. As TEC is weighted by the maximum ionospheric density, the corresponding altitude (hmF2) is, generally, assumed as the perturbation detection altitude. To investigate the validity of this assumption in detail, we conduct an accurate analysis of the GPS-TEC measured early ionospheric signatures related to the vertical surface displacement of the Mw 7.4 Sanriku-Oki earthquake (Sanriku-Oki Tohoku foreshock). Using 3D acoustic ray tracing model to describe the evolution of the propagating seismo-acoustic wave in space and time, we demonstrate how to infer the detection altitude of these early signatures in TEC. We determine that the signatures can be detected at altitudes up to similar to 130 km below the hmF2. This peculiar behaviour is attributed to the satellite line of sight (LOS) geometry and station location with respect to the source, which allows one to sound the co-seismic ionospheric signatures directly above the rupture area. We show that the early onset times correspond to crossing of the LOS with the acoustic wavefront at lower ionospheric altitudes. To support the proposed approach, we further reconstruct the seismo-acoustic induced ionospheric signatures for a moving satellite in the presence of a geomagnetic field. Both the 3D acoustic ray tracing model and the synthetic waveforms from the 3D coupled model substantiate the observed onset time of the ionospheric signatures. Moreover, our simple 3D acoustic ray tracing approach allows one to extend this analysis to azimuths different than that of the station-source line.","Thomas, Dhanya

"savedrecs (30).txt","The separation of motile sperm from semen samples is sought after for medical infertility treatments. In this work, we demonstrate a high-throughput microfluidic device that can passively isolate motile sperm within corrals inside a fluid channel, separating them from the rest of the diluted sample. Using finite element method simulations and proposing a model for sperm motion, we investigated how flow rate can provide a rheotaxis zone in front of the corral for sperm to move upstream/downstream depending on their motility. Using three different flow rates that provided shear rates above the minimum value within the rheotaxis zone, we experimentally tested the device with human and bovine semen. By taking advantage of the rheotactic behavior of sperm, this microfluidic device is able to corral motile sperm with progressive velocities in the range of 48-93 mu m.s(-1) and 51-82 mu ms(-1) for bovine and human samples, respectively. More importantly, we demonstrate that the separated fractions of both human and bovine samples feature 100% normal progressive motility. Furthermore, by extracting the sperm swimming distribution within the rheotaxis zone and sperm velocity distribution inside the corral, we show that the minimum velocity of the corralled sperm can be adjusted by changing the flow rate; that is, we are able to control the motility of the separated sample. This microfluidic device is simple to use, is robust, and has a high throughput compared with traditional methods of motile sperm separation, fulfilling the needs for sperm sample preparation for medical treatments, clinical applications, and fundamental studies.","Zaferani, Meisam

"savedrecs (30).txt","Nonbreeding season territoriality is found in many mammal species irrespective of diet, being found in carnivores, granivores, and herbivores. However, we know the hormonal basis for this behavior in virtually none. American martens (Martes americana) show strong intrasexual, year-round territoriality. We collected serum samples from both territorial and transient males and documented size metrics and movement patterns with live-capture and radiotelemetry from September to June in 3 years in Southeast Alaska. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA-a prohormone that can be converted in the brain to active gonadal hormones) levels were high (comparable to humans and rodents showing nonbreeding season spacing behavior) and did not change over the nonbreeding season in territorial males. In contrast, testosterone levels were low in autumn and increased as the summer breeding season approached. Territorial males were larger than transients in some measures and had higher testosterone levels, but similar DHEA and cortisol levels (total and free). DHEA levels declined with age. Our evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that DHEA, not testosterone, is the basis for territoriality outside the breeding season in martens, but collection of serum from females and experimental manipulations are required to provide conclusive evidence.","Boonstra, Rudy

"savedrecs (30).txt","Background
The previous studies on basketball landing have not shown a systematic agreement between landing impacts and midsole densities. One plausible reason is that the midsole densities alone used to represent the cushioning capability of a shoe seems over simplified. The aim of this study is to examine the effects of different landing heights and shoes of different cushioning performance on tibial shock, impact loading and knee kinematics of basketball players.
Methods
Nineteen university team basketball players performed drop landings from different height conditions (0.45m vs. 0.61m) as well as with different shoe cushioning properties (regular, better vs. best-cushioned). For each condition, tibial acceleration, vertical ground reaction force and knee kinematics were measured with a tri-axial accelerometer, force plate and motion capture system, respectively. Heel comfort perception was indicated on the 150-mm Visual Analogue Scale. A 2 (height) x 3 (footwear) ANOVA with repeated measures was performed to determine the effects of different landing heights and shoe cushioning on the measured parameters.
Results
We did not find significant interactions between landing height and shoe conditions on tibial shock, impact peak, mean loading rate, maximum knee flexion angle and total ankle range of motion. However, greater tibial shock, impact peak, mean loading rates and total ankle range of motion were determined at a higher landing height (P<0.01). Regular-cushioned shoes demonstrated significantly greater tibial shock and mean loading rate compared with better- and best-cushioned shoes (P< 0.05). The correlation analysis indicated that the heel comfort perception was fairly associated with impact peak and mean loading rate regardless of heights (P<0.05), but not associated with tibial shock.
Conclusions
Determination of shoe cushioning performance, regardless of shoe midsole materials and constructions, would be capable in order to identify optimal shoe models for better protection against tibial stress fracture. Subjective comfort rating could estimate the level of impact loading in non-laboratory based situations.","Wei, Qiang

"savedrecs (30).txt","Assessing the movements and connectivity of whale sharks Rhincodon typus through their range is difficult due to high individual mobility and limited knowledge of their behaviour following dispersal from coastal aggregation sites. Here, we use a large set of photo-identification and stable isotope data (delta N-15 and delta C-13) to test the assumption that sharks frequenting aggregation sites in Mozambique, Tanzania, and Qatar are a mixed stock, as inferred by genetic data. Photo-identification revealed negligible connectivity among aggregation sites and none between the southern and central areas of the Western Indian Ocean (Mozambique and Tanzania) and the Arabian Gulf (Qatar). Sight-resight data indicated that shark movements at each site could be best represented by a model that included emigration, re-immigration, and some mortality or permanent emigration. Although there was high individual variation in the isotope profiles of sharks from each location, comparison with latitudinal isotope data suggests that sharks had shown site fidelity to within a few hundred kilometres of each study area over the period of isotopic integration. Given the Endangered status of whale sharks and regional differences in anthropogenic threat profiles, further studies-and conservation assessment efforts-should consider the possibility that whale shark subpopulations exist over smaller geographical scales than previously documented.","Prebble, Clare E.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Forming spawning aggregations is a critical life-history activity for fish, but it is unclear what physical conditions are associated with fish behavior at specific sites. The habitat, movements and distribution of blackfin snapper Lutjanus fulvus at a monthly aggregation site in Palau were studied using a combination of instruments and approaches, including active/passive acoustics, time-lapse cameras, an autonomous underwater vehicle, current profilers, and high resolution bathymetry. We found that L. fulvus predictably form a large pre-spawning aggregation of an estimated 15 000 fish in a small zone (10s of m) in a tidally forced channel. The aggregation spans 125 m along the northern channel wall, with the highest densities of fish from 9 to 13 m and <15 m from the wall where current velocities are <0.25 m s(-1). The aggregation occurs within an indent in the channel wall where an abrupt change in bathymetry creates a visible eddy-like feature during outgoing tides. The aggregation forms year-round, for 6 d each moon cycle, starting 1 d before the full moon to 4 d after. During the study, 4 tagged fish returned to the site for 6 consecutive lunar cycles; however, residency times within aggregation periods was similar to 1.5 d on average. Densely aggregated fish were present during the day, but migration patterns of tagged fish revealed regular evening migrations to and from the channel mouth, consistently at the highest tide of the day, a behavior assumed for spawning. These observations reveal some physical processes and biological patterns surrounding the formation and function of fish aggregations.","Cimino, Megan

"savedrecs (30).txt","Inter-individual variation in behavioural traits has important implications for evolutionary and ecological processes. Site fidelity, where individuals consistently use the same foraging site, is common among marine predators. Sex differences in foraging are also well studied in marine vertebrates, but the extent to which consistent inter-individual differences in foraging vary between the sexes is poorly known. Here we quantified the effects of sex on individual foraging site fidelity (IFSF), both within and between years, in chick-brooding Campbell albatross Thalassarche impavida. Using bird-borne global positioning system loggers, we calculated route fidelity (nearest-neighbour distance), repeatability of site fidelity (terminal latitude and longitude), and foraging effort (total distance travelled and trip duration) during 2 to 10 repeat trips. Overall, Campbell albatrosses showed a high degree of site fidelity. Birds travelled to similar sites not only within the same year, but also between 2 consecutive years, suggesting that the within-year consistency is not simply in response to short-term patches of food. Moreover, within the same year, we found differences in terms of IFSF between the sexes. Females that foraged closer to the colony in neritic and shelf waters were more likely to follow similar routes on repeated foraging trips and were more consistent in their foraging effort than males. Males that foraged further offshore in pelagic waters had more repeatable foraging longitudes than females. Our study provides further evidence of the importance of IFSF among marine vertebrates. However, it also reveals that the strength of such specialisations may vary with sex.","Sztukowski, Lisa A.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Conservation authorities invest heavily in the restoration and/or creation of wetlands to counteract the destruction of habitat caused by urbanization. Monitoring the colonization of these new wetlands is critical to an adaptive management process. We conducted a turtle mark-recapture survey in a 250 ha artificially created wetland complex in a large North American city (Toronto, Ontario). We found that two of Ontario's eight native turtle species (Snapping turtle (SN), Chelydra serpentina, and Midland Painted (MP) turtle, Chrysemys picta marginata) were abundant and both were confirmed nesting. The Blanding's turtle (Emydoidea blandingii) was present but not well established. Species richness and turtle density were not equally distributed throughout the wetland complex. We noted SN almost exclusively populated one water body, while other areas of the wetland had a varying representation of both species. The sex ratios of both SN and MP turtles were 1:1. We tracked the movement of Snapping and Blanding's turtles and found that most turtles explored at least two water bodies in the park, that females explored more water bodies than males, and that 95% of turtles showed fidelity to individual overwintering wetlands. We performed DNA analysis of two Blanding's turtles found in the created wetlands and could not assign these turtles to any known profiled populations. The genetic data suggest that the turtles probably belong to a remnant local population. We discuss the implications of our results for connectivity of artificial wetlands and the importance of the whole wetland complex to this turtle assemblage.","Dupuis-Desormeaux, Marc

This type of robot is modelled as a free-floating mechanical system subject to external forces and constrained by whole-body distributed rigid contacts. Measurements of the state of the robot can be made using a variety of sensor information-such as kinematics (the sensing of the joint angles of the robot), contact force (pressure sensors in the robot's feet), accelerometers and gyroscopes as well as external sensors such as vision and LIDAR. This high-frequency state estimate is then passed to the control system of the robot to allow it to traverse terrain or manipulate its environment. In this article, we describe the development of an estimator for the Boston Dynamics Atlas humanoid robot. It was later adapted to the HyQ2 quadruped, developed by the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Visual memory is crucial to navigation in many animals, including insects. Here, we focus on the problem of visual homing, that is, using comparison of the view at a current location with a view stored at the home location to control movement towards home by a novel shortcut. Insects show several visual specializations that appear advantageous for this task, including almost panoramic field of view and ultraviolet light sensitivity, which enhances the salience of the skyline. We discuss several proposals for subsequent processing of the image to obtain the required motion information, focusing on how each might deal with the problem of yaw rotation of the current view relative to the home view. Possible solutions include tagging of views with information from the celestial compass system, using multiple views pointing towards home, or rotation invariant encoding of the view. We illustrate briefly how a well-known shape description method from computer vision, Zernike moments, could provide a compact and rotation invariant representation of sky shapes to enhance visual homing. We discuss the biological plausibility of this solution, and also a fourth strategy, based on observed behaviour of insects, that involves transfer of information from visual memory matching to the compass system.","Stone, Thomas

"savedrecs (30).txt","Tremendous volumes of messages on social media platforms provide supplementary traffic information and encapsulate crowd wisdom for solving transportation problems. However, social media messages manifested in human languages are usually characterized with redundant, fuzzy and subjective features. Here, we develop a data fusion framework to identify social media messages reporting non-recurring traffic events by connecting the traffic events with traffic states inferred from taxi global positioning system (GPS) data. Temporal-patial information of traffic anomalies caused by the traffic events are then retrieved from anomalous traffic states. The proposed framework successfully identified accidental traffic events with various scales and exhibited strong performance in event descriptions. Even though social media messages are generally posted after the occurrence of anomalous traffic states, resourceful event descriptions in the messages are helpful in explaining traffic anomalies and for deploying suitable countermeasures.","Zheng, Zhihao

"savedrecs (30).txt","Background: Animals change their habitat use in response to spatio-temporal fluctuation of resources. Some resources may vary periodically according to the moonphase. Yet it is poorly documented how animals, particularly nocturnal mammals, adjust their use of space in response to the moonphase. Here, we asked if an obligate nocturnal mammal, the aerial-hawking common noctule bat (Nyctalus noctula), adjusts its 3-dimensional flight behaviour and habitat use to the lunar period. Using miniaturized GPS loggers, we recorded 3-dimensional flight tracks of N. noctula and related these to a canopy height model derived from aerial laser scans to investigate whether bats adjust forest strata use to moonlight intensities.
Results: Noctules frequently foraged above the canopy of coniferous forest at low moonlight intensities, but switched to using open grasslands and arable fields in nights with high moonlight intensities. During the few occasions when noctules used the forest during moonlit nights, they mostly restricted their use of space to flying below the canopy level. The median overall flight altitude of N. noctula equalled 13 +/- 16 m but reached up to 71 m above ground (97.5% quantile).
Conclusions: Our findings argue against general lunar phobic behaviour of aerial-hawking bats. We suggest that the preferred use of open fields around full moon may be a strategy of noctules to increase the success of hunting airborne insects at night. Specifically, the adjustment in use of space may allow bats to hunt for insects that emerge and disperse over open fields during bright moonlight.","[Anonymous]","[Anonymous]",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Flight altitude; Forest structure; Habitat use; LiDAR; Moonlight;

"savedrecs (30).txt","The degree of three-dimensional movement exhibited by animals depends, in part, on their style of locomotion. For example, surface-bound animals such as humans are always in contact with the ground and, consequently, their travel in the vertical dimension is largely dictated by the topography of the terrain. In contrast, nonsurface-bound (flying and swimming) animals can move equally in all three dimensions. Research from the last 20 years has indicated that many animals learn and remember information about the vertical and horizontal dimensions with different degrees of accuracy, and that this may be influenced by their style of locomotion; however, there has been no overview to determine whether these differences follow general patterns and there have been few attempts to explain the reasons behind them. The aims of this article are twofold. First, we review the literature on vertical and horizontal navigation, comparing the relative accuracy of these processes in surface-bound and nonsurface-bound animals, and critically appraising the key contributing factors. Second, we hope to establish a framework to help direct researchers interested in the effects of locomotory style on navigation to areas of the field where data are lacking or where there have been contradictory findings that need to be resolved. We suggest that as there are currently few studies investigating three-dimensional navigation, the field would benefit from more studies in a larger variety of species, in particular flying and swimming species that nest and forage on the ground or in the benthic zone and arboreal surface-bound animals that must regularly move in three dimensions through the canopy. This will enable us to determine whether real differences in spatial learning exist between animals exhibiting different styles of locomotion and, if differences do exist, allow us to establish general principles that can explain these differences in spatial learning between species.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Simple Summary Transport-related problem behaviors (TRPBs) are unwanted behaviors exhibited by horses in one or multiple phases of transport contributing to the injury of the horses and their handlers. The aim of this study was to identify risk factors for TRPBs in support of the development of best practices that minimize their incidence, and safeguard horse and handler wellbeing. An online cross-sectional survey was designed and disseminated to New Zealand equine industry members. Respondents were asked whether one of their horses had shown TRPBs during the two previous years, and to describe their equine background and experience, the method or way in which they had trained their horses for loading and travelling, the type of aids they used for loading and the type of vehicle. At least one horse was reported as showing a TRPB by almost one out of four of respondents. The type of vehicle, of training and of aids used for loading and travelling resulted associated with TRPBs. These findings may be useful to enhance horse welfare by educating people in charge of moving horses on appropriate training methods and vehicle selection for road transportation.
Abstract Transport-related problem behaviors (TRPBs) are common in horses and can cause injury to both the horses and their handlers. This study aimed to identify possible risk factors for TRPBs to inform approaches to mitigate TRPBs incidence and enhance horse welfare. An online cross-sectional survey was conducted to explore the prevalence of TRPBs and their association with human-, training- and transport management-related factors in New Zealand. The survey generated 1124 valid responses that were analyzed using descriptive statistics, and logistic regression analyses. Having at least one horse with TRPB was reported by 249/1124 (22.2%) respondents during the two previous years. Of these, 21/249 (8.4%) occurred during pre-loading, 78/249 (31.3%) during loading, 132/249 (53.0%) while travelling, and 18/249 (7.3%) during unloading. Our findings indicate that the use of negative reinforcement and positive punishment as training methods, using a whip or food for loading, and travelling in a straight load trailer/float while offering food were associated with a higher likelihood of TRPBs. Cross-sectional studies cannot determine causality and findings should be interpreted with caution, and evaluated in further experimental studies. The authors suggest that education on appropriate training methods for transport, and vehicle selection may mitigate the risk for TRPBs in horses.","Padalino, Barbara

"savedrecs (30).txt","Free-roaming dogs (FRDs) pose a significant health threat to humans, other animals and the environment. Yet, the effects of their movements and habitat use within cities and adjacent rural areas are poorly known, especially in relation to predation and the transmission of diseases that can impact human health (i.e., cystic echinococcosis and rabies). We explored the temporal and spatial distribution of owned FRDs for a remote Patagonian city surrounded by a grasslands rural ecosystem by superimposing GPS coordinates of tracked dogs on satellite images (Google map). Using logistic regressions, we evaluated the potential effect of age, body condition score (BCS) and distance from their initial recorded GPS fix (at or near the owner's home) to the rural boundary (RD) as predictors of home range (HR) and maximum distance (MD) travelled from home. Our study revealed that owned FRDs in Puerto Natales, Chile have a high site fidelity to the urban environment and especially their owners home, seldom venturing into rural areas. We observed that even FRDs living in close proximity to the city boundary spent most of their time within the urban environment. On average, FRDs had a HR of 0.65 km(2) (65 ha) and travelled a MD of 1.05 km. There were two individuals that travelled significantly further, and hence occupied a larger HR than the rest. Additionally, our results indicated that BCS was a predictor of HR, while age and RD were predictors of MD. These findings add to the range of predictors known to affect roaming dog HR size and used across different studies, suggesting that site-specific factors are likely affecting dog behavioral ecology. The study findings provide useful and original data on the movement ecology and site fidelity of owned FRDs in a remote city in Patagonia. We recommend that to make meaningful and cost-effective management decisions regarding owned FRDs in urban areas, future studies should also include the collection of sociocultural information on the interactions between of dogs and people.","Perez, Guillermo E.

"savedrecs (30).txt","1. Fin whales ( Balaenoptera physalus) have been documented along the coast of Chile since the early 20th century; however, information on their ecology and movement patterns remains poorly known. 2. In the spring of 2015, six implantable satellite tags were deployed on fin whales around the marine reserves of Isla Chanaral and Islas Choros-Damas ( approximately 29 degrees S) to evaluate their movements and habitat use off the coast of Chile. A switching state-space model was used to estimate the predicted track of the whales as well as behavioural modes classified as ` transiting' and ` area-restricted search' ( ARS). 3. Whales were tracked for periods ranging between 4 and 162 days ( mean = 68 +/- 52 days), covering an average distance of 3225.7 +/- 2871.6 km. Five of the six whales remained at middle latitudes for prolonged periods of time, moving in a north-south pattern near the coast, and spending most of their time in ARS behaviour ( 72.5% of the locations). Only one individual showed a clear southbound migratory behaviour, and remained in transit behaviour for most of the period it was followed. 4. These results suggest that some of the fin whales that are observed in Chile do follow a migration to high latitudes, whereas others remained at middle latitudes, probably using critical habitats as feeding grounds during the summer. This information not only contributes new information on the behaviour and foraging patterns of this species, but is also of particular interest to promote the growing whale-watching activity, and also to better inform conservation and management efforts for this species in Chile.","Sepulveda, Maritza

"savedrecs (30).txt","Variation in intrinsic (body mass, reproductive condition) and extrinsic factors (habitat quality, spatio-temporal variation in food availability) can affect the costs and benefits of personality traits. Relationships between personality and fitness components can vary with changes in population density and/or habitat quality. Here, using capture-mark-recapture data of individually marked Eurasian red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris), we explored whether indices of boldness and exploration are correlated with local survival in either of the sexes and with a measure of reproductive success in females, under different conditions of food availability. PCA scores derived from the number of captures (trappability) and number of different traps where an individual was captured (trap diversity), in the first 1 or 2 years of presence, were used as indices of personality (boldness and pure exploration). The relationships between boldness and local survival differed between habitats in both sexes. Bold squirrels survived better than shy ones in Norway spruce forest, while in the other two study areas (Scots pine or mixed spruce-fir forest), survival was lower for bolder squirrels. Pure exploration behavior was negatively correlated with local survival in all habitats and in both sexes. Female reproductive success increased with body mass and decreased with the tendency to explore, a relationship consistent across habitat types. Bolder females did not have a reproductive advantage in years of poor food availability. We suggest that costs and benefits of boldness vary with spatio-temporal differences in availability of high-quality food resources which may help to maintain variation in personality in red squirrels in heterogeneous landscapes.
Differences in personality among individuals can affect their survival or reproductive success. We investigated the relationship between personality traits and fitness components in Eurasian red squirrels under different food availability. We scored boldness and exploration using indices derived from capture-mark-recapture data. Bold red squirrels survived longer than shy ones in spruce forest where food availability varied strongly between years. Instead, in mixed forests with more stable food supplies, shy individuals survived longer. Heavy females produced more litters in their lifetime than those with lower body mass. Explorative squirrels were more likely to die young and to produce no or few litters, independent of the habitat they lived in. Our results suggest that variation in personality traits within populations of Eurasian red squirrels was maintained by changing fitness benefits in relation to habitat type in pulsed resource systems.","Santicchia, Francesca

"savedrecs (30).txt","As human development intensifies in northern ecosystems, negative impacts of anthropogenic disturbances on wildlife could increase. Many caribou and reindeer populations are declining across the northern hemisphere, and human disturbances have been suggested as a potential cause for these declines. We evaluated the effects of human disturbances in the summer and winter ranges of two migratory caribou herds in northern Quebec and Labrador, Canada. We captured and collared 510 caribou between 2009 and 2015. We first assessed caribou avoidance of human disturbances at a large spatial scale by comparing the density of mines, mining exploration sites, power lines, roads and human settlements within seasonal ranges to their density within available ranges. We estimated the area avoided by caribou (ZOI; zone of influence) around disturbances located within seasonal ranges and evaluated the resulting cumulative habitat loss. We also evaluated the barrier effect of roads and their influence on caribou movement rates. The density of many disturbance types was lower within caribou seasonal ranges than within available ranges, suggesting they avoided disturbances over a large spatial scale. Within seasonal ranges, caribou avoided all disturbance types except power lines. ZOIs were highly variable among disturbance types and years, ranging from no avoidance to 23 km. Cumulative habitat loss could reach as much as 30% of seasonal ranges and 38% of high-quality caribou habitat. We demonstrate that human disturbances have broad negative effects on caribou behavior, but whether this could translate into population decline remains to be investigated.","Plante, Sabrina

"savedrecs (30).txt","Increasingly imperative objectives in ecology are to understand and forecast population dynamic and evolutionary responses to seasonal environmental variation and change. Such population and evolutionary dynamics result from immediate and lagged responses of all key life-history traits, and resulting demographic rates that affect population growth rate, to seasonal environmental conditions and population density. However, existing population dynamic and eco-evolutionary theory and models have not yet fully encompassed within-individual and among-individual variation, covariation, structure and heterogeneity, and ongoing evolution, in a critical life-history trait that allows individuals to respond to seasonal environmental conditions: seasonal migration. Meanwhile, empirical studies aided by new animal-tracking technologies are increasingly demonstrating substantial within-population variation in the occurrence and form of migration versus year-round residence, generating diverse forms of 'partial migration' spanning diverse species, habitats and spatial scales. Such partially migratory systems form a continuum between the extreme scenarios of full migration and full year-round residence, and are commonplace in nature.
Here, we first review basic scenarios of partial migration and associated models designed to identify conditions that facilitate the maintenance of migratory polymorphism. We highlight that such models have been fundamental to the development of partial migration theory, but are spatially and demographically simplistic compared to the rich bodies of population dynamic theory and models that consider spatially structured populations with dispersal but no migration, or consider populations experiencing strong seasonality and full obligate migration. Second, to provide an overarching conceptual framework for spatio-temporal population dynamics, we define a 'partially migratory meta-population' system as a spatially structured set of locations that can be occupied by different sets of resident and migrant individuals in different seasons, and where locations that can support reproduction can also be linked by dispersal. We outline key forms of within-individual and among-individual variation and structure in migration that could arise within such systems and interact with variation in individual survival, reproduction and dispersal to create complex population dynamics and evolutionary responses across locations, seasons, years and generations. Third, we review approaches by which population dynamic and eco-evolutionary models could be developed to test hypotheses regarding the dynamics and persistence of partially migratory meta-populations given diverse forms of seasonal environmental variation and change, and to forecast system-specific dynamics. To demonstrate one such approach, we use an evolutionary individual-based model to illustrate that multiple forms of partial migration can readily co-exist in a simple spatially structured landscape. Finally, we summarise recent empirical studies that demonstrate key components of demographic structure in partial migration, and demonstrate diverse associations with reproduction and survival. We thereby identify key theoretical and empirical knowledge gaps that remain, and consider multiple complementary approaches by which these gaps can be filled in order to elucidate population dynamic and eco-evolutionary responses to spatio-temporal seasonal environmental variation and change.","Reid, Jane M.

Wolves (Canis lupus Linnaeus, 1758) in the central Apennines, Italy, have coexisted with humans since historic times and represent a good case study to assess their spatiotemporal response to anthropogenic factors. From 2008 to 2010, we investigated the spatial behavior of wolves (seven wolves in five packs and six floaters) in the Abruzzo Lazio and Molise National Park. Orograpillcally corrected annual home ranges of resident wolf packs, estimated through the Brownian bridge movement model, averaged 104 +/- 24 km(2) (mean +/- SD), whereas floaters used two- to fourfold larger areas (293.8-408.7 km(2)). We did not detect any seasonal effect on home range size, but home ranges were larger during the night and in areas of greater road density, especially during summer. By estimating core areas through an individual-based approach, we also revealed a habitat-mediated response to human presence and activity, as resident wolves preferentially established core areas at greater elevation and in the more forested and inaccessible portions of the home range.","Mancinelli, S.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Populations inhabiting the bioclimatic edges of a species' geographic range face an increasing amount of stress from alterations to their environment associated with climate change. Moose Alces alces are large-bodied ungulates that are sensitive to heat stress and have exhibited population declines and range contractions along their southern geographic extent. Using a hidden Markov model to analyzemovement and accelerometer data, we assigned behaviors (rest, forage, or travel) to all locations of global positioning system-collaredmoose (n = 13, moose-years = 19) living near the southern edge of the species' range in and around Voyageurs National Park, MN, USA. We assessed how moose behavior changed relative to weather, landscape, and the presence of predators. Moose significantly reduced travel and increased resting behaviors at ambient temperatures as low as 15 degrees C and 24 degrees C during the spring and summer, respectively. In general, moose behavior changed seasonally in association with distance to lakes and ponds. Moose used wetlands for travel throughout the year, rested in conifer forests, and foraged in shrublands. The influence of wolves Canis lupus varied among individual moose and season, but the largest influence was a reduction in travel during spring when near a wolf home range core, primarily by pregnant females. Our analysis goes beyond habitat selection to capture how moose alter their activities based on their environment. Our findings, along with climate change forecasts, suggest that moose in this area will be required to further alter their activity patterns and space use in order to find sufficient forage and avoid heat stress.","Ditmer, Mark A.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Herring gulls (Larus argentatus) are opportunistic predators that prefer to forage in the intertidal zone, but an increasing degree of terrestrial foraging has recently been observed. We therefore aimed to analyze the factors influencing foraging behavior and diet composition in the German Wadden Sea. Gulls from three breeding colonies on islands at different distances from the mainland were equipped with GPS data loggers during the incubation seasons in 2012-2015. Logger data were analyzed for 37 individuals, including 1,115 foraging trips. Herring gulls breeding on the island furthest from the mainland had shorter trips (mean total distance=12.3km; mean maximum distance=4.2km) and preferred to feed on the tidal flats close to the colony, mainly feeding on common cockles (Cerastoderma edule) and shore crabs (Carcinus maenas). In contrast, herring gulls breeding close to the mainland carried out trips with a mean total distance of 26.7km (mean maximum distance=9.2km). These gulls fed on the neobiotic razor clams (Ensis leei) in the intertidal zone, and a larger proportion of time was spent in distant terrestrial habitats on the mainland, feeding on earthworms. C-13 and N-15 values were higher at the colony furthest from the mainland and confirmed a geographical gradient in foraging strategy. Analyses of logger data, pellets, and stable isotopes revealed that herring gulls preferred to forage in intertidal habitats close to the breeding colony, but shifted to terrestrial habitats on the mainland as the tide rose and during the daytime. Reduced prey availability in the vicinity of the breeding colony might force herring gulls to switch to feed on razor clams in the intertidal zone or to use distant terrestrial habitats. Herring gulls may thus act as an indicator for the state of the intertidal system close to their breeding colony.","Enners, Leonie

"savedrecs (30).txt","1. Animals are often required to make decisions about their use of current resources while minimising travel costs and risks due to uncertainty about the forthcoming resources. Passive soaring birds utilise warm rising-air columns (thermals) to climb up and obtain potential energy for flying across large areas. However, the utilisation of such inconsistent natural resources may be challenging for soaring-gliding birds and involve a set of decisions to maintain efficient flight.
2. To assess which temporal scales of previous experience with environmental inputs best predicted thermal-climbing departure decisions of soaring birds, we used movement data from Eurasian griffon vultures (Gyps fulvus) tracked by GPS transmitters. We applied Cox proportional hazard regression and a model selection approach to identify thermal-climbing departure decisions and to compare a range of temporal scales.
3. Our findings support the use of current and recent (short-term; last 20 min) experiences, compared to longer term, past experiences, in predicting the time until departure from thermals. The models supported decision rules that integrated information originating from different temporal scales, implying a tendency to depart from a thermal later when the current climb rate was higher than experienced recently and vice versa. In addition, climb rates in thermals revealed significant autocorrelation over short time-scales (shorter than 30 min).
4. The correspondence between thermals' characteristics and the factors that best predicted thermal-climbing departure decisions presumably reflects optimal decisions individuals make to handle their dynamic environment and to reduce movement-related costs of such a basic activity for soaring-gliding birds.","Harel, Roi

Limestone langurs (Trachypithecus genus), including the Critically Endangered Cat Ba langur (Trachypithecus poliocephalus), live on limestone karst hills with shrubby and discontinuous vegetation. This study explores home range size and habitat use in relation to substrate, vegetation coverage, and hill type for Cat Ba langurs living on Cat Ba Island. We predicted that home range size would be similar to that of other limestone langurs and that as resources vary seasonally and across habitat types, habitat use would vary with season and behavior, with foraging concentrated on slopes, where food is plentiful. We collected 180 days of observational data on two reproductive groups (N = 7 and N = 10-13), taking GPS fixes of the group whenever they moved farther than the typical group spread to determine home ranges, and 10-min instantaneous scans to assess habitat use. The two groups had home ranges of 22 ha and 50 ha (0.32 and 0.20-0.26 individuals/ha respectively). Ranges for both groups were smaller in the dry season than the wet season, although we could not assess seasonal variation statistically. The langurs spent most scans on rocks, in sparsely vegetated areas, and on exposed slopes and steep cliffs; however they foraged primarily on gradually inclined slopes, especially in the dry season. These results suggest that conservation efforts should focus on protecting nutritionally important valleys and exposed slopes to ensure year-long access to food resources. It may, however, be difficult to balance human and nonhuman primate habitat use.","Hendershott, Rebecca

"savedrecs (30).txt","Echolocating bats often forage in the presence of both conspecific and heterospecific individuals, which have the potential to produce acoustic interference. Recent studies have shown that at least one bat species, the Brazilian free-tailed bat (Tadarida brasiliensis), produces specialized social signals that disrupt the sonar of conspecific competitors. We herein discuss the differences between passive and active jamming signals and test whether heterospecific jamming occurs in species overlapping spatiotemporally, as well as whether such interference elicits a jamming avoidance response. We compare the capture rates of tethered moths and the echolocation parameters of big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) challenged with the playback of the jamming signal normally produced by Brazilian free-tailed bats and playback of deconstructed versions of this signal. There were no differences in the capture rates of targets with and without the jamming signal, although significant changes in both spectral and temporal features of the bats' echolocation were observed. These changes are consistent with improvements of the signal-to-noise ratio in the presence of acoustic interference. Accordingly, we propose to expand the traditional definition of the jamming avoidance response, stating that echolocation changes in response to interference should decrease similarity between the two signals, to include any change that increases the ability to separate returning echoes from active jamming stimuli originating from conspecific and heterospecific organisms. Flexibility in echolocation is an important characteristic for overcoming various forms of acoustic interference and may serve a purpose in interspecific interactions as well as intraspecific ones.","Jones, Te K.

Tagged sharks showed significantly higher routine oxygen consumption and lower swimming speeds than untagged animals, indicating that tagging significantly affected the swimming efficiency and energetic requirements in these small sharks, and that these effects must be accounted for when interpreting telemetry data from free-ranging individuals.","Lear, Karissa O.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Long-term and widespread monitoring programs are essential to understanding the role of human-dominated landscapes in supporting wild bee populations. Urbanization results in increased impervious surfaces throughout the landscape, fragmentation of green space, and a loss of naturally occurring floral vegetation. All of these changes have a negative impact on pollinator diversity. The objective of this study was to assess the abundance and richness of wild bee species throughout a small city in northwest Pennsylvania and identify how management of land throughout the city may influence bee communities. Seventeen sites across a land use gradient, moving from areas with large open spaces and mainly permeable surfaces, to sites in the city center consisting of mainly impermeable surfaces, were sampled over a 2-year period. During this time, 106 known species were identified with four state records and 1 undescribed species. Bee species richness was greatest at sites with the largest amount of permeable surface and naturally-occurring, native vegetation. Richness decreased on the college campus and city center where landscapes were highly managed and impermeable surfaces were most abundant. While floral richness was not related to bee abundance and richness, the number of open blooms near traps did have a positive impact on bee species richness. Overall, this survey revealed considerable richness never before recorded for northwest Pennsylvania, suggesting the importance of conservation management in homeowner and community yard space.","Choate, Beth A.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Inter-individual contacts in wildlife populations are usually highly heterogeneous. This variation translates into differential disease transmission rates between individuals, which have vital consequences for the spread, persistence, and control of infectious diseases. Wild boar (Sus scrofa) is an abundant game species across Europe that poses serious health threats to wildlife, livestock, and humans. However, factors shaping contact rates and structure in wild boar populations, key parameters in disease ecology, remain poorly studied. We quantified dyadic association rates, as a proxy of contacts, and individual-based network centrality measures using telemetry data from 3 wild boar populations across Europe. Next, we examined the effect of sex, age, group membership, and space use on association rates and individual centrality. Contact rates depended strongly on the distance between individual home ranges; the most frequent associations occurred at distances of 0-1km (mostly within groups), less frequent at 1-3km (mostly between groups), and sporadic at >4km. Association rates were an order of magnitude higher within social groups than between them. Between-group association rates were only dependent on the distance between groups, with no apparent effect of animal sex or age. At the social network level, young animals (0.5-2 yr) showed greater between-group connectivity and a more central position in the network than adults. Our results highlight substantial contact heterogeneities in wild boar populations, which should be considered in epidemiological modeling and disease control actions. First, wild boar contact rates are strongly constrained socially and spatially. Hence, management measures reducing these constraints, such as supplementary feeding and intensive hunting, may lead to increased disease transmission rates. Second, young wild boars show exceptional connectivity within the population, highlighting their high capacity for disease transmission. Therefore, targeted removal of yearlings should be considered to optimize disease control efforts. (c) 2018 The Wildlife Society.","Podgorski, Tomasz

"savedrecs (30).txt","Acoustic tracking is a commonly used method to study the movement ecology of marine species. The characteristics of the data collected are not simply functions of the location of the tagged animal as they are also influenced by the method of data collection and its sampling frequency. In particular, since the data are acoustically driven, the significance of any result hinges not only on the accuracy of the equipment but also on the reliability of the information received. While passive acoustic telemetry requires an evaluation of the detection efficiency of receivers moored in different habitats (or sites) to obtain reliable data, active acoustic telemetry requires more field-related information on how to best track tagged animals without impacting on their natural behaviour. This study aimed to evaluate the reliability of active acoustic telemetry data in a temperate coastal environment. This was achieved by conducting a series of field experiments to assess (i) the use of signal strength-to-infer distance to the tracked animal under different tracking conditions, (ii) what signal strength threshold can be used to obtain reliable bio-telemetered data, (iii) whether the behaviour of a tracked animal would be a main concern in terms of data reliability, and (iv) the best filtering option to reduce the data to be analysed. The findings yielded a signal strength-to-distance relationship to improve the accuracy of the positional fixes of actively tracked animals, which can be used as a practical reference for future tracking studies on pelagic species in temperate coastal environments.","Gennari, Enrico

"savedrecs (30).txt","Body size latitudinal clines have been widley explained by the Bergmann's rule in homeothermic vertebrates. However, there is no general consensus in poikilotherms organisms in particular in insects that represent the large majority of wildlife. Among them, bees are a highly diverse pollinators group with high economic and ecological value. Nevertheless, no comprehensive studies of species assemblages at a phylogenetically larger scale have been carried out even if they could identify the traits and the ecological conditions that generate different patterns of latitudinal size variation. We aimed to test Bergmann's rule for wild bees by assessing relationships between body size and latitude at continental and community levels. We tested our hypotheses for bees showing different life history traits (i.e. sociality and nesting behaviour). We used 142 008 distribution records of 615 bee species at 50 x 50 km (CGRS) grids across the West Palearctic. We then applied generalized least squares fitted linear model (GLS) to assess the relationship between latitude and mean body size of bees, taking into account spatial autocorrelation. For all bee species grouped, mean body size increased with higher latitudes, and so followed Bergmann's rule. However, considering bee genera separately, four genera were consistent with Bergmann's rule, while three showed a converse trend, and three showed no significant cline. All life history traits used here (i.e. solitary, social and parasitic behaviour; ground and stem nesting behaviour) displayed a Bergmann's cline. In general there is a main trend for larger bees in colder habitats, which is likely to be related to their thermoregulatory abilities and partial endothermy, even if a 'season length effect' (i.e. shorter foraging season) is a potential driver of the converse Bergmann's cline particularly in bumblebees.","Gerard, Maxence

"savedrecs (30).txt","Individuals vary greatly in the distance they disperse, and in doing so, strongly affect ecological and evolutionary processes. Dispersal, when viewed as a component of phenotype, can be affected independently or jointly by environment. However, among taxa with complex life cycles that occupy different habitats over ontogeny, the effects of environment on dispersal and the interaction between environment and phenotype remains poorly understood. Here, we conducted a field experiment to measure how dispersal distance was affected by phenotype, environment experienced before and after metamorphosis, and their interaction. We manipulated the environment encountered by a pond-breeding salamander Ambystoma annulatum during the aquatic larval stage and again as dispersing terrestrial juveniles. After assaying juvenile phenotype (exploration behavior, body condition, and morphology), we then measured the initial distance dispersed by juveniles. The distance moved by dispersing salamanders was affected by attributes of both larval and juvenile habitat, with salamanders that encountered low quality habitat in either life stage moving the farthest. However, we did not find support for an interactive effect of phenotype and environment affecting the distance moved by dispersers. Interestingly, exploration behavior explained the distance moved by philopatric animals but not dispersing ones. Our findings indicate that the environment experienced before metamorphosis can affect juvenile dispersal behavior, and demonstrates the need to consider dispersal in species with complex life cycles to understand the coupling between local and regional population dynamics.","Ousterhout, Brittany H.

"savedrecs (30).txt","The Internet and Big data have become indispensable in people's daily life. The whole participation spectrum of cyberspace collective actions contains four stages, such as Access, Browse, Participate, and Offline. There exist three transition probabilities within four stages. This paper focuses on the ratio (second transition probability) between numbers of browse and participate, which is defined as the participate propensity P-BP. In the real world, amounts of browse (millions) and participation (tens of thousands) are huge, and they take on irregular distributions. However, it is discovered in this paper that this participate propensity is stable and takes on the regularity of 5 parts per thousand, i.e. the participation propensity is slightly under 5 parts per thousand for most times, while sometimes it is slightly over 5 parts per thousand. The empirical big data of 310 online collective actions are collected from a famous BBS (Tianya.cn) in China. This 5 parts per thousand rule not only holds true for the total 310 cases, but also for the yearly, quarterly, and other subgroups. Furthermore, we check distributive traits of P-BP. It is not normally distributed as it has longer right tails. It is verified by the empirical big data that the propensity follows the lognormal distribution, which is relatively robust in the total and subgroups of 310 cyberspace collective actions. Given the distributive regularity of the participate propensity P-BP, its probability density function can be obtained. Combined with the known amount of browsers, big data prediction of participation would be possible. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","Lu, Peng

"savedrecs (30).txt","In in-vivo motion analyses, data from a limited number of subjects and trials is used as proxy for locomotion properties of entire populations, yet the inherent hierarchy of the individual and population level is usually not accounted for. Despite the increasing availability of hierarchical model frameworks for statistical analyses, they have not been applied extensively to comparative motion analysis. As a case study for the use of hierarchical models, we analyzed locomotor parameters of four Swinhoe's striped squirrels. The small-bodied arboreal mammals exhibit brief bouts of rapid asymmetric gaits. Spatio-temporal parameters on runways with experimentally varied dimensions of the setup enclosure were compared to test for their potentially confounding effects. We applied principal component analysis to evaluate changes to the overall locomotor pattern. A common, non-hierarchical, pooled statistical analysis of the data revealed significant differences in some of the parameters depending on enclosure dimensions. In contrast, we used a hierarchical Bayesian generalized linear model (GLM) that considers subject specific differences and population effects to compare the effect of enclosure dimensions on the measured parameters and the principal components. None of the population effects were confirmed by the hierarchical GLM. The confounding effect of a single subject that deviates in its locomotor behavior is potentially bigger than the influence of the experimental variation in enclosure dimensions. Our findings justify the common practice of researchers to intuitively select an enclosure with dimensions assumed as ""non-constraining"". Hierarchical models can easily be designed to cope with limited sample size and bias introduced by deviating behavior of individuals. When limited data is available-a typical restriction of in-vivo motion analyses of non-model organisms-density distributions of the Bayesian GLM used here remain reliable and the hierarchical structure of the model optimally exploits all available information. We provide code to be adjusted to other research questions.","Mielke, Falk

"savedrecs (30).txt","To understand how species will respond to environmental changes, it is important to know how those changes will affect the ecological stress that animals experience. Time constraints can be used as indicators of ecological stress. Here we test whether time constraints can help us understand group sizes, distribution patterns, and community sizes of forest guenons (Cercopithecus/Allochrocebus). Forest guenons typically live in small to medium sized one-male-multifemale groups and often live in communities with multiple forest guenon species. We developed a time-budget model using published data on time budgets, diets, body sizes, climate, and group sizes to predict maximum ecologically tolerable group and community sizes of forest guenons across 202 sub-Saharan African locations. The model correctly predicted presence/absence at 83% of these locations. Feeding-foraging time (an indicator of competition) limited group sizes, while resting and moving time constraints shaped guenon biogeography. Predicted group sizes were greater than observed group sizes but comparable to community sizes, suggesting community sizes are set by competition among guenon individuals irrespective of species. We conclude that time constraints and intraspecific competition are unlikely to be the main determinants of relatively small group sizes in forest guenons. Body mass was negatively correlated with moving time, which may give larger bodied species an advantage over smaller bodied species under future conditions when greater fragmentation of forests is likely to lead to increased moving time. Resting time heavily depended on leaf consumption and is likely to increase under future climatic conditions when leaf quality is expected to decrease.","Korstjens, Amanda H.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) have provided an excellent way to monitor micro-deformation in real-time. However, at local sites where landslides frequently occur, the environment can include complex surroundings with mountains, dense vegetation, and human settlements, which can severely degrade the accuracy of positioning with the GNSS technique. In this study, we propose an azimuth-dependent elevation weight (ADEW) model using an azimuth-dependent elevation mask (ADEM) to reduce the effects of multipath errors and improve the accuracy of real-time deformation monitoring in such environments. We developed an adaptive fixed-elevation mask to serve as the outlier of low precision observations at lower elevations for the ADEM, and then, we applied the weighted phase observations into the mitigation process for the effects of multipath errors. The real numerical results indicate that the ADEM model performs better than the conventional model, and the average improvements were 18.91% and 34.93% in the horizontal and vertical direction, respectively. The ADEW model further improved upon the ADEM model results by an additional 21.9% and 29.8% in the horizontal and vertical direction, respectively. Therefore, we propose that the ADEW model can significantly mitigate the effects of multipath errors and improve the accuracy of micro-deformation monitoring via GNSS receivers.","Han, Junqiang

"savedrecs (30).txt","Due to the non-contact detection ability of radar and the harmlessness of terahertz waves to the human body, three-dimensional (3D) imaging using terahertz synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is an efficient method of security detection in public areas. To achieve high-resolution and all aspect imaging, circular trajectory movement of radar and linear sensor array along the height direction were used in this study. However, the short wavelength of terahertz waves makes it practically impossible for the hardware to satisfy the half-wavelength spacing condition to avoid grating lobes. To solve this problem, a sparse linear array model based on the equivalent phase center principle was established. With the designed imaging geometry and corresponding echo signal model, a 3D imaging algorithm was derived. Firstly, the phase-preserving algorithm was adopted to obtain the 2D image of the ground plane for each sensor. Secondly, the sparse recovery method was applied to accomplish the scattering coefficient reconstruction along the height direction. After reconstruction of all the range-azimuth cells was accomplished, the final 3D image was obtained. Numerical simulations and experiments using terahertz radar were performed. The imaging results verify the effectiveness of the 3D imaging algorithm for the proposed model and validate the feasibility of terahertz radar applied in security detection.","Hao, Jubo

"savedrecs (30).txt","The ability to objectively measure episodes of rest has clear application for assessing health and well-being. Accelerometers afford a sensitive platform for doing so and have demonstrated their use in many human-based trials and interventions. Current state of the art methods for predicting sleep from accelerometer signals are either based on posture or low movement. While both have proven to be sensitive in humans, the methods do not directly transfer well to dogs, possibly because dogs are commonly alert but physically inactive when recumbent. In this paper, we combine a previously validated low-movement algorithm developed for humans and a posture-based algorithm developed for dogs. The hybrid approach was tested on 12 healthy dogs of varying breeds and sizes in their homes. The approach predicted state of rest with a mean accuracy of 0.86 (SD = 0.08). Furthermore, when a dog was in a resting state, the method was able to distinguish between head up and head down posture with a mean accuracy of 0.90 (SD = 0.08). This approach can be applied in a variety of contexts to assess how factors, such as changes in housing conditions or medication, may influence a dog's resting patterns.","Ladha, Cassim

"savedrecs (30).txt","Anthropogenic alterations to landscape structure and composition can have significant impacts on biodiversity, potentially leading to species extinctions. Population-level impacts of landscape change are mediated by animal behaviors, in particular dispersal behavior. Little is known about the dispersal habits of rails (Rallidae) due to their cryptic behavior and tendency to occupy densely vegetated habitats. The effects of landscape structure on the movement behavior of waterbirds in general are poorly studied due to their reputation for having high dispersal abilities. We used a landscape genetic approach to test hypotheses of landscape effects on dispersal behavior of the Hawaiian gallinule (Gallinula galeata sandvicensis), an endangered subspecies endemic to the Hawaiian Islands. We created a suite of alternative resistance surfaces representing biologically plausible a priori hypotheses of how gallinules might navigate the landscape matrix and ranked these surfaces by their ability to explain observed patterns in genetic distance among 12 populations on the island of O`ahu. We modeled effective distance among wetland locations on all surfaces using both cumulative least-cost-path and resistance-distance approaches and evaluated relative model performance using Mantel tests, a causal modeling approach, and the mixed-model maximum-likelihood population-effects framework. Across all genetic markers, simulation methods, and model comparison metrics, surfaces that treated linear water features like streams, ditches, and canals as corridors for gallinule movement outperformed all other models. This is the first landscape genetic study on the movement behavior of any waterbird species to our knowledge. Our results indicate that lotic water features, including drainage infrastructure previously thought to be of minimal habitat value, contribute to habitat connectivity in this listed subspecies.","van Rees, Charles B.

"savedrecs (30).txt","Few long-term, large-scale studies have been conducted about the factors likely to explain changes in species abundance and distribution in winter. Range shifts are generally attributed to the climate change or land use. This study shows that other factors such as species protection and the ensuing increasing numbers of individuals and competition could be involved. It details the progressive conquest of France, the most important European wintering area for great cormorant, in three decades as its legal protection by the EU Birds Directive. It is based on 13 exhaustive national counts. Cormorants first occupied the farthest areas (Atlantic and Mediterranean lagoons, then larger rivers) from the main-core European breeding area, with only progressive occupancy of the northeastern part later. This strategy mainly resulted from competition for optimal available feeding areas. Suboptimal areas (smaller wetlands harboring smaller night roosts, colder northeastern French areas) and progressive fragmentation of large night roosts into smaller, better located ones minimized flight costs. The coldest areas were occupied last, once other areas were saturated. Their occupancy was favored locally by the global climate change, but it played a minor role in these strategies. Both factors induced only a small NNE shift of the weighted centroid range of the wintering population (2.6km/year) which mainly resulted from competition (buffer effect). Only the 2009 cold wave decreased the total number of wintering cormorants at the national scale, once the population had probably reached the carrying capacity of the country, while the previous cold waves had a minor effect. Comparatively, there was a greater SSE range shift of the weighted centroid of the breeding population (4.66km/year). Range shifts of other recently protected species have been attributed to the sole climate change in the literature, but competition due to the saturation of usual wintering or breeding areas should be considered too.","Marion, Loic

"savedrecs (30).txt","Winter recreation is a widely popular activity and is expected to increase due to changes in recreation technology and human population growth. Wildlife are frequently negatively impacted by winter recreation, however, through displacement from habitat, alteration of activity patterns, or changes in movement behavior. We studied impacts of dispersed and developed winter recreation on Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis) at their southwestern range periphery in Colorado, USA. We used GPS collars to track movements of 18 adult lynx over 4years, coupled with GPS devices that logged 2,839 unique recreation tracks to provide a detailed spatial estimate of recreation intensity. We assessed changes in lynx spatial and temporal patterns in response to motorized and nonmotorized recreation, as well as differences in movement rate and path tortuosity. We found that lynx decreased their movement rate in areas with high-intensity back-country skiing and snowmobiling, and adjusted their temporal patterns so that they were more active at night in areas with high-intensity recreation. We did not find consistent evidence of spatial avoidance of recreation: lynx exhibited some avoidance of areas with motorized recreation, but selected areas in close proximity to nonmotorized recreation trails. Lynx appeared to avoid high-intensity developed ski resorts, however, especially when recreation was most intense. We conclude that lynx in our study areas did not exhibit strong negative responses to dispersed recreation, but instead altered their behavior and temporal patterns in a nuanced response to recreation, perhaps to decrease direct interactions with recreationists. However, based on observed avoidance of developed recreation, there may be a threshold of human disturbance above which lynx cannot coexist with winter recreation.","Olson, Lucretia E.
